## Instructions

The contents of this directory can be autogenerated using the script 
scripts/swagger/codegen_swagger_models.py

### [Legacy Details]

[2022-09-09: The following notes are being kept (for the time being) as they 
describe the starting point for the design of the codegen_swagger_models.py 
script, although these will eventually become out of date.]

The following are instructions for updating the GroMEt Schema data model.

The contents of this directory are autogenerated using the swagger-codegen. 
See the instructions in the description at the top of the `gromet_FN_v
{CURRENT_VERSION}`, which can be found here:
- https://ml4ai.github.io/automates-v2/

After following steps 1-3 in the above instructions, you will now have a 
directory named `$OUTPUT_PATH` (in the instructions, this directory is 
named `client`) that contains the full implementation of the 
swagger-generated client code. We are only interested in the generated data 
model classes. The Python classes are located here: 
`$OUTPUT_PATH/swagger_client/models/`

To update the SKEMA (AutoMATES) GroMEt schema data model, do the following:

1. Place all the generated python files under 
   `$OUTPUT_PATH/swagger_client/models/`,_except_ `metadata.py`, into _this_ 
   directory, i.e.:
   `<AutoMATES>/automates/model_assembly/gromet/model/`
   Doing so will overwrite any matching files already in this directory.
   
   (Don't copy `metadata.py` because the implementation of `metadata.py` under 
   `<AutoMATES>/automates/model_assembly/gromet/metadata/` will be used as 
   the reference for the top-level Metadata class definition.)

2. When the data model code was autogenerated, swagger assumed the code 
   is in the context of `swagger_client.models` python path. Because we are 
   moving just the data models to the new context within the automates project, 
   this means that for module inheritance we need to manually fix the module 
   paths to instead import `automates.model_assembly.gromet.model`. For 
   example, the import line:
      ```
      from swagger_client.models.gromet_box import GrometBox
      ```
   must be changed to:
      ```
      from automates.model_assembly.gromet.model.gromet_box import GrometBox
      ```
   This change must be made manually for the following files:
   - `gromet_box_conditional.py`
   - `gromet_box_function.py`
   - `gromet_box_loop.py`
   - `__init__.py`

4. After copying over data models files, you can now delete `$OUTPUT_PATH` 
   directory tree (e.g.: `$ rm -rf client`).
   And if you are updating the model in the master, you can add, commit, 
   push the updated data model files.
