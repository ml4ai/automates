    "text": "Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes deaths: dead individuals are still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the disease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. In other words, the model consists of individuals who are either Susceptible (S), Infected (I), or Recovered (R). The function I, measured in individuals, first increases exponentially.\nThe relations of interest are governed by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations: dS dt = −rS(t)I(t) dI dt = rS(t)I(t) − aI(t) dR dt = aI(t) dS dt = −rS(t)I(t) − rPS(t)IP (t) where r is the infection rate and a the removal rate of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propagation of the disease and can also be used as control\nparameters in order to stop the epidemic. The infection rate is measured in germs per second and ranges between 0.2 and 5.6 germs per second. Infection rate of 0.5 germs per second is considered low, and r of 65 germs per second is considered high. When r is negative, it is time to celebrate."

    "heading": "1 Reproduction number",
    "text": "There are two epidemics, one epidemic is SARS caused by a coronavirus virus, call it virus A. An important descriptive parameter of virus A is the basic reproduction number, or R0, measured in microbes per year. This represents the average number of people who will be infected by any given infected person. When R0 is greater than 1, it means that a disease will grow. When the basic reproduction number is between 0.5 and 1, the danger is moderate. A higher R0 implies more rapid transmission and a more rapid growth of the epidemic.\nR0 is larger when the pathogen is more infectious people are infectious for longer periods of time the number susceptible people is higher. Right now, we have an R0 of 2.71 mm, but last month the basic reproduction number was 100 m2/year."

    "heading": "2 Transmissibility",
    "text": "The model’s parameters, β and γ , determine the severity of the epidemic.\nβ = τ × c which is the transmissibility τ multiplied by the average number of people exposed\nc. The transmissibility is the basic virulence of the pathogen.\nTransmissibility is measured in millimeters. For example, if we take the susceptible S = 6.8 million people (e.g. the case of Hong Kong) and the infected class of I = 10 individuals, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then transmissibility is set to 32 mm. But other times, τ = 450 mm, for example, when a = 3 and susceptibles = 4.5 million. Currently, I is positive.\nFor many deterministic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully\nsusceptible population if and only if R0 > 1.\nReferences Ng, Tuen Wai, Gabriel Turinici, and Antoine Danchin. ”A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation.” BMC Infectious Diseases 3.1 (2003): 1-16."
