    priority: ${priority}
    type: token

    example: "EORATIO is defined as the maximum Kcs at LAI = 6.0"
    pattern: |
      [entity = /NUMBER|PERCENT/ & tag = /CD/] [word = /x|-/] [entity = /NUMBER|PERCENT/ & tag = /CD/]

      [entity = /NUMBER|PERCENT/ & !lemma = "%" & !tag=/TO|CC/]{2,}
      # note: second rule added to address cases like "12 milions". got rid of tag = /CD/ part ("millions" is captured as number, but does not have tag = /CD/. It is tagged as /NNS/.)

    label: Value
    priority: ${compoundPriority}
    type: token
    example: "63 million of cats"
