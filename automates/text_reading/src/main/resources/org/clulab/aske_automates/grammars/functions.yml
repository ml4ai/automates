rules:

  # todo: the number of inputs is undecided. how to incorporate unspecified number of inputs into the rules? (for now, most of the rules are set to have two inputs)
  # todo: a lot of inputs and outputs need to be expanded.
  # todo: some of the rules have very similar structure, though their trigger words differ. Would it be possible to capture them in a single rule?
