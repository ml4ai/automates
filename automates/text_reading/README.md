## Prerequistes for using Python interface

The Python interface depends on pygraphviz to render plots of the dependency parse, 
and this in turn depends on graphviz.

### Mac (High Sierra 10.13.5)

If you have installed graphviz using Homebrew 
and you are then installing pygraphviz using pip, you need to do the following:
```bash
pip install --install-option="--include-path=/usr/local/include/" \
            --install-option="--library-path=/usr/local/lib" pygraphviz
```
