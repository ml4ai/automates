    "text": "(guidelines for computing crop water requirements)\nby Richard G. ALLEN Utah State University Logan, Utah, U.S.A.\nLuis S. PEREIRA\nInstituto Superior de Agronomia Lisbon, Portugal\nDirk RAES\nKatholieke Universiteit Leuven Leuven, Belgium\nMartin SMITH\nFAO, Water Resources, Development and Management Service Rome, Italy\nCrop evapotranspiration\niii\nPreface\nThis publication presents an updated procedure for calculating reference and crop evapotranspiration from meteorological data and crop coefficients. The procedure, first presented in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24 'Crop Water Requirements', is termed the 'Kc ETo' approach, whereby the effect of the climate on crop water requirements is given by the reference evapotranspiration ETo and the effect of the crop by the crop coefficient Kc. Other procedures developed in FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24 such as the estimation of dependable and effective rainfall, the calculation of irrigation requirements and the design of irrigation schedules are not presented in this publication but will be the subject of later papers in the series. Since the publication of FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24 in 1977, advances in research and more accurate assessment of crop water use have revealed the need to update the FAO methodologies for calculating ETo. The FAO Penman method was found to frequently overestimate ETo while the other FAO recommended equations, namely the radiation, the BlaneyCriddle, and the pan evaporation methods, showed variable adherence to the grass reference crop evapotranspiration. In May 1990, FAO organized a consultation of experts and researchers in collaboration with the International Commission for Irrigation and Drainage and with the World Meteorological Organization, to review the FAO methodologies on crop water requirements and to advise on the revision and update of procedures. The panel of experts recommended the adoption of the Penman-Monteith combination method as a new standard for reference evapotranspiration and advised on procedures for calculating the various parameters. The FAO Penman-Monteith method was developed by defining the reference crop as a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0.12 m, with a surface resistance of 70 s m-1 and an albedo of 0.23, closely resembling the evaporation from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively growing and adequately watered. The method overcomes the shortcomings of the previous FAO Penman method and provides values that are more consistent with actual crop water use data worldwide. Furthermore, recommendations have been developed using the FAO Penman-Monteith method with limited climatic data, thereby largely eliminating the need for any other reference evapotranspiration methods and creating a consistent and transparent basis for a globally valid standard for crop water requirement calculations. The FAO Penman-Monteith method uses standard climatic data that can be easily measured or derived from commonly measured data. All calculation procedures have been standardized according to the available weather data and the time scale of computation. The calculation methods, as well as the procedures for estimating missing climatic data, are presented in this publication."

    "text": "aggregation of the physical and physiological differences between crops. Two calculation methods\niv\nto derive crop evapotranspiration from ETo are presented. The first approach integrates the relationships between evapotranspiration of the crop and the reference surface into a single Kc coefficient. In the second approach, Kc is split into two factors that separately describe the evaporation (Ke) and transpiration (Kcb) components. The selection of the Kc approach depends on the purpose of the calculation and the time step on which the calculations are to be executed. The final chapters present procedures that can be used to make adjustments to crop coefficients to account for deviations from standard conditions, such as water and salinity stress, low plant density, environmental factors and management practices. Examples demonstrate the various calculation procedures throughout the publication. Most of the computations, namely all those required for the reference evapotranspiration and the single crop coefficient approach, can be performed using a pocket calculator, calculation sheets and the numerous tables given in the publication. The user may also build computer algorithms, either using a spreadsheet or any programming language. These guidelines are intended to provide guidance to project managers, consultants, irrigation engineers, hydrologists, agronomists, meteorologists and students for the calculation of reference and crop evapotranspiration. They can be used for computing crop water requirements for both irrigated and rainfed agriculture, and for computing water consumption by agricultural and natural vegetation.\nCrop evapotranspiration\nv\nAcknowledgements These guidelines constitute the efforts of eight years of deliberations and consultations by the authors, who together formed the working group to pursue the recommendations of the FAO expert consultation that was held in May 1990 in Rome. The consultation was organized to review the then current FAO guidelines to determine Crop Water Requirements, published in 1977 as FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper No. 24 (FAO-24) and authored by J. Doorenbos and W. Pruitt. The conceptual framework for the revised methodologies introduced in this publication came forth out of the advice of the group of eminent experts congregated in the 1990 meetings and who have importantly contributed to the development of the further studies conducted in the framework of the publication. Members of the 1990 FAO expert consultation included Dr P. Fleming of Australia, Dr A. Perrier of France, Drs L. Cavazza and L. Tombesi from Italy, Drs R. Feddes and"

    "heading": "Evaporation",
    "text": "Evaporation is the process whereby liquid water is converted to water vapour (vaporization) and removed from the evaporating surface (vapour removal). Water evaporates from a variety of surfaces, such as lakes, rivers, pavements, soils and wet vegetation. Energy is required to change the state of the molecules of water from liquid to vapour. Direct solar radiation and, to a lesser extent, the ambient temperature of the air provide this energy. The driving force to remove water vapour from the evaporating surface is the difference between the water vapour pressure at the evaporating surface and that of the surrounding atmosphere. As evaporation proceeds, the surrounding air becomes gradually saturated and the process will slow down and might stop if the wet air is not transferred to the atmosphere. The replacement of the saturated air with drier air depends greatly on wind speed. Hence, solar radiation, air temperature, air humidity and wind speed are climatological parameters to consider when assessing the evaporation process.\nWhere the evaporating surface is the soil surface, the degree of shading of the crop canopy and the amount of water available at the evaporating surface are other factors that affect the evaporation process. Frequent rains, irrigation and water transported upwards in a soil from a shallow water table wet the soil surface. Where the soil is able to supply water fast enough to satisfy the evaporation demand, the evaporation from the soil is determined only by the meteorological conditions. However, where the interval between rains and irrigation becomes large and the ability of the soil to conduct moisture to near the surface is small, the water content in the topsoil drops and the soil surface dries out. Under these circumstances the limited availability of water exerts a controlling influence on soil evaporation. In the absence of any supply of water to the soil surface, evaporation decreases rapidly and may cease almost completely within a few days.\nIntroduction to evapotranspiration 2\nFIGURE 2 The partitioning of evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration over the growing period for an annual field crop\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\ntime\npa rt\niti on\nin g\nof e\nva po\ntr an\nsp ira\ntio n\nle af\na re\na in\nde x\n(L A\nI)\nevaporation\ntranspiration\nsowing harvest\ncrop\nsoil\nL A I\nCrop evapotranspiration\n3"

    "heading": "Transpiration",
    "text": "Transpiration consists of the vaporization of liquid water contained in plant tissues and the vapour removal to the atmosphere. Crops predominately lose their water through stomata. These are small openings on the plant leaf through which gases and water vapour pass (Figure 1). The water, together with some nutrients, is taken up by the roots and transported through the plant. The vaporization occurs within the leaf, namely in the intercellular spaces, and the vapour exchange with the atmosphere is controlled by the stomatal aperture. Nearly all water taken up is lost by transpiration and only a tiny fraction is used within the plant.\nTranspiration, like direct evaporation, depends on the energy supply, vapour pressure gradient and wind. Hence, radiation, air temperature, air humidity and wind terms should be considered when assessing transpiration. The soil water content and the ability of the soil to conduct water to the roots also determine the transpiration rate, as do waterlogging and soil water salinity. The transpiration rate is also influenced by crop characteristics, environmental aspects and cultivation practices. Different kinds of plants may have different transpiration rates. Not only the type of crop, but also the crop development, environment and management should be considered when assessing transpiration."

    "heading": "Evapotranspiration (ET)",
    "text": "Evaporation and transpiration occur simultaneously and there is no easy way of distinguishing between the two processes. Apart from the water availability in the topsoil, the evaporation from a cropped soil is mainly determined by the fraction of the solar radiation reaching the soil surface. This fraction decreases over the growing period as the crop develops and the crop canopy shades more and more of the ground area. When the crop is small, water is predominately lost by soil evaporation, but once the crop is well developed and completely covers the soil, transpiration becomes the main process. In Figure 2 the partitioning of evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration is plotted in correspondence to leaf area per unit surface of soil below it. At sowing nearly 100% of ET comes from evaporation, while at full crop cover more than 90% of ET comes from transpiration."

    "heading": "UNITS",
    "text": "The evapotranspiration rate is normally expressed in millimetres (mm) per unit time. The rate expresses the amount of water lost from a cropped surface in units of water depth. The time unit can be an hour, day, decade, month or even an entire growing period or year.\nAs one hectare has a surface of 10 000 m2 and 1 mm is equal to 0.001 m, a loss of 1 mm of water corresponds to a loss of 10 m3 of water per hectare. In other words, 1 mm day-1 is equivalent to 10 m3 ha-1 day-1.\nWater depths can also be expressed in terms of energy received per unit area. The energy refers to the energy or heat required to vaporize free water. This energy, known as the latent heat of vaporization (λ), is a function of the water temperature. For example, at 20°C, λ is about 2.45 MJ kg-1. In other words, 2.45 MJ are needed to vaporize 1 kg or 0.001 m3 of water. Hence, an energy input of 2.45 MJ per m2 is able to vaporize 0.001 m or 1 mm of water, and therefore 1 mm of water is equivalent to 2.45 MJ m-2. The evapotranspiration rate expressed in units of MJ m-2 day-1 is represented by λET, the latent heat flux.\nIntroduction to evapotranspiration 4\nTable 1 summarizes the units used to express the evapotranspiration rate and the conversion factors.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n5"

    "text": "Factors such as soil salinity, poor land fertility, limited application of fertilizers, the presence of hard or impenetrable soil horizons, the absence of control of diseases and pests and poor soil management may limit the crop development and reduce the evapotranspiration. Other factors to be considered when assessing ET are ground cover, plant density and the soil water content. The effect of soil water content on ET is conditioned primarily by the magnitude of the water deficit and the type of soil. On the other hand, too much water will result in waterlogging which might damage the root and limit root water uptake by inhibiting respiration.\nWhen assessing the ET rate, additional consideration should be given to the range of management practices that act on the climatic and crop factors affecting the ET process. Cultivation practices and the type of irrigation method can alter the microclimate, affect the crop characteristics or affect the wetting of the soil and crop surface. A windbreak reduces wind velocities and decreases the ET rate of the field directly beyond the barrier. The effect can be significant especially in windy, warm and dry conditions although evapotranspiration from the trees themselves may offset any reduction in the field. Soil evaporation in a young orchard, where trees are widely spaced, can be reduced by using a well-designed drip or trickle irrigation system. The drippers apply water directly to the soil near trees, thereby leaving the major part of the soil surface dry, and limiting the evaporation losses. The use of mulches, especially when the crop is small, is another way of substantially reducing soil evaporation. Anti-transpirants, such as stomata-closing, film-forming or reflecting material, reduce the water losses from the crop and hence the transpiration rate.\nIntroduction to evapotranspiration 6\nCrop evapotranspiration\n7\nWhere field conditions differ from the standard conditions, correction factors are required to adjust ETc.

    "heading": "Reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo)",
    "text": "The evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface, not short of water, is called the reference crop evapotranspiration or reference evapotranspiration and is denoted as ETo. The reference surface is a hypothetical grass reference crop with specific characteristics. The use of other denominations such as potential ET is strongly discouraged due to ambiguities in their definitions.\nThe concept of the reference evapotranspiration was introduced to study the evaporative demand of the atmosphere independently of crop type, crop development and management practices. As water is abundantly available at the reference evapotranspiring surface, soil factors do not affect ET. Relating ET to a specific surface provides a reference to which ET from other surfaces can be related. It obviates the need to define a separate ET level for each crop and stage of growth. ETo values measured or calculated at different locations or in different seasons are comparable as they refer to the ET from the same reference surface.\nThe only factors affecting ETo are climatic parameters. Consequently, ETo is a climatic parameter and can be computed from weather data. ETo expresses the evaporating power of the atmosphere at a specific location and time of the year and does not consider the crop characteristics and soil factors. The FAO Penman-Monteith method is recommended as the sole method for determining ETo. The method has been selected because it closely approximates grass ETo at the location evaluated, is physically based, and explicitly incorporates both physiological and aerodynamic parameters. Moreover, procedures have been developed for estimating missing climatic parameters.\nTypical ranges for ETo values for different agroclimatic regions are given in Table 2. These values are intended to familiarize inexperienced users with typical ranges, and are not intended for direct application. The calculation of the reference crop evapotranspiration is discussed in Part A of this handbook (Box 1). Crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ETc)\nThe crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions, denoted as ETc, is the evapotranspiration from disease-free, well-fertilized crops, grown in large fields, under optimum soil water conditions, and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions.\nIntroduction to evapotranspiration 8\nCrop evapotranspiration\n9\nThe amount of water required to compensate the evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field is defined as crop water requirement. Although the values for crop evapotranspiration and crop water requirement are identical, crop water requirement refers to the amount of water that needs to be supplied, while crop evapotranspiration refers to the amount of water that is lost through evapotranspiration. The irrigation water requirement basically represents the difference between the crop water requirement and effective precipitation. The irrigation water requirement also includes additional water for leaching of salts and to compensate for non-uniformity of water application. Calculation of the irrigation water requirement is not covered in this publication, but will be the topic of a future Irrigation and Drainage Paper.\nCrop evapotranspiration can be calculated from climatic data and by integrating directly the crop resistance, albedo and air resistance factors in the Penman-Monteith approach. As there is still a considerable lack of information for different crops, the Penman-Monteith method is used for the estimation of the standard reference crop to determine its evapotranspiration rate, i.e., ETo. Experimentally determined ratios of ETc/ETo, called crop coefficients (Kc), are used to relate ETc to ETo or ETc = Kc ETo.\nDifferences in leaf anatomy, stomatal characteristics, aerodynamic properties and even albedo cause the crop evapotranspiration to differ from the reference crop evapotranspiration under the same climatic conditions. Due to variations in the crop characteristics throughout its growing season, Kc for a given crop changes from sowing till harvest. The calculation of crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ETc) is discussed in Part B of this handbook (Box 2). Crop evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc adj)\nThe crop evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc adj) is the evapotranspiration from crops grown under management and environmental conditions that differ from the standard conditions. When cultivating crops in fields, the real crop evapotranspiration may deviate from ETc due to non-optimal conditions such as the presence of pests and diseases, soil salinity, low soil fertility, water shortage or waterlogging. This may result in scanty plant growth, low plant density and may reduce the evapotranspiration rate below ETc.\nThe crop evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions is calculated by using a water stress coefficient Ks and/or by adjusting Kc for all kinds of other stresses and environmental constraints on crop evapotranspiration. The adjustment to ETc for water stress, management and environmental constraints is discussed in Part C of this handbook (Box 3)."

Therefore the evapotranspiration process is governed by energy exchange at the vegetation surface and is limited by the amount of energy available. Because of this limitation, it is possible to predict the evapotranspiration rate by applying the principle of energy conservation. The energy arriving at the surface must equal the energy leaving the surface for the same time period.\nAll fluxes of energy should be considered when deriving an energy balance equation. The equation for an evaporating surface can be written as: Rn − G - λET − H = 0 (1) where Rn is the net radiation, H the sensible heat, G the soil heat flux and λET the latent heat flux. The various terms can be either positive or negative. Positive Rn supplies energy to the surface and positive G, λET and H remove energy from the surface (Figure 5).\nIn Equation 1 only vertical fluxes are considered and the net rate at which energy is being transferred horizontally, by advection, is ignored. Therefore the equation is to be applied to large, extensive surfaces of homogeneous vegetation only. The equation is restricted to the four components: Rn, λET, H and G. Other energy terms, such as heat stored or released in the plant, or the energy used in metabolic activities, are not considered These terms account for only a small fraction of the daily net radiation and can be considered negligible when compared with the other four components.\nThe latent heat flux (λET) representing the evapotranspiration fraction can be derived from the energy balance equation if all other components are known. Net radiation (Rn) and soil heat fluxes (G) can be measured or estimated from climatic parameters. Measurements of the sensible heat (H) are however complex and cannot be easily obtained. H requires accurate measurement of temperature gradients above the surface.\nAnother method of estimating evapotranspiration is the mass transfer method. This approach considers the vertical movement of small parcels of air (eddies) above a large homogeneous surface. The eddies transport material (water vapour) and energy (heat, momentum) from and towards the evaporating surface. By assuming steady state conditions and that the eddy transfer coefficients for water vapour are proportional to those for heat and momentum, the evapotranspiration rate can be computed from the vertical gradients of air temperature and water vapour via the Bowen ratio. Other direct measurement methods use gradients of wind speed and water vapour. These methods and other methods such as eddy covariance, require accurate measurement of vapour pressure, and air temperature or wind speed at different levels above the surface. Therefore, their application is restricted to primarily research situations."

The reference surface closely resembles an extensive surface of green, well-watered grass of uniform height, actively growing and completely shading the ground. The fixed surface resistance of 70 s m-1 implies a moderately dry soil surface resulting from about a weekly irrigation frequency. ETo can be computed from meteorological data. As a result of an Expert Consultation held in May 1990, the FAO Penman-Monteith method is now recommended as the sole standard method for the definition and computation of the reference evapotranspiration.

    "text": "A large number of more or less empirical methods have been developed over the last 50 years by numerous scientists and specialists worldwide to estimate evapotranspiration from different climatic variables. Relationships were often subject to rigorous local calibrations and proved to have limited global validity. Testing the accuracy of the methods under a new set of conditions is laborious, time-consuming and costly, and yet evapotranspiration data are frequently needed at short notice for project planning or irrigation scheduling design. To meet this need, guidelines were developed and published in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24 'Crop water requirements'. To accommodate users with different data availability, four methods were presented to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo): the Blaney-Criddle, radiation, modified Penman and pan evaporation methods. The modified Penman method was considered to offer the best results with minimum possible error in relation to a living grass reference crop. It was expected that the pan method would give acceptable estimates, depending on the location of the pan. The radiation method was suggested for areas where available climatic data include measured air temperature and sunshine, cloudiness or radiation, but not measured wind speed and air humidity. Finally, the publication proposed the use of the Blaney-Criddle method for areas where available climatic data cover air temperature data only.\nThese climatic methods to calculate ETo were all calibrated for ten-day or monthly calculations, not for daily or hourly calculations. The Blaney-Criddle method was recommended for periods of one month or longer. For the pan method it was suggested that calculations should be done for periods of ten days or longer. Users have not always respected these conditions and calculations have often been done on daily time steps.\nAdvances in research and the more accurate assessment of crop water use have revealed\nweaknesses in the methodologies. Numerous researchers analysed the performance of the four methods for different locations. Although the results of such analyses could have been influenced by site or measurement conditions or by bias in weather data collection, it became evident that the proposed methods do not behave the same way in different locations around the world. Deviations from computed to observed values were often found to exceed ranges indicated by FAO. The modified Penman was frequently found to overestimate ETo, even by\nFAO Penman-Monteith equation 18\nup to 20% for low evaporative conditions. The other FAO recommended equations showed variable adherence to the reference crop evapotranspiration standard of grass.\nTo evaluate the performance of these and other estimation procedures under different climatological conditions, a major study was undertaken under the auspices of the Committee on Irrigation Water Requirements of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The ASCE study analysed the performance of 20 different methods, using detailed procedures to assess the validity of the methods compared to a set of carefully screened lysimeter data from 11 locations with variable climatic conditions. The study proved very revealing and showed the widely varying performance of the methods under different climatic conditions. In a parallel study commissioned by the European Community, a consortium of European research institutes evaluated the performance of various evapotranspiration methods using data from different lysimeter studies in Europe.\nThe studies confirm the overestimation of the modified Penman introduced in FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24, and the variable performance of the different methods depending on their adaptation to local conditions. The comparative studies may be summarized as follows: • The Penman methods may require local calibration of the wind function to achieve\nsatisfactory results. • The radiation methods show good results in humid climates where the aerodynamic term\nis relatively small, but performance in arid conditions is erratic and tends to underestimate evapotranspiration.\n• Temperature methods remain empirical and require local calibration in order to achieve satisfactory results. A possible exception is the 1985 Hargreaves’ method which has shown reasonable ETo results with a global validity.\n• Pan evapotranspiration methods clearly reflect the shortcomings of predicting crop evapotranspiration from open water evaporation. The methods are susceptible to the microclimatic conditions under which the pans are operating and the rigour of station maintenance. Their performance proves erratic.\n• The relatively accurate and consistent performance of the Penman-Monteith approach in both arid and humid climates has been indicated in both the ASCE and European studies.\nThe analysis of the performance of the various calculation methods reveals the need for formulating a standard method for the computation of ETo. The FAO Penman-Monteith method is recommended as the sole standard method. It is a method with strong likelihood of correctly predicting ETo in a wide range of locations and climates and has provision for application in data-short situations. The use of older FAO or other reference ET methods is no longer encouraged."

The resistance nomenclature distinguishes between aerodynamic resistance and surface resistance factors (Figure 7).

The surface resistance, rs, describes the resistance of vapour flow through stomata openings, total leaf area and soil surface.

The Leaf Area Index (LAI), a dimensionless quantity, is the leaf area (upper side only) per unit area of soil below it. It is expressed as m2 leaf area per m2 ground area. The active LAI is the index of the leaf area that actively contributes to the surface heat and vapour transfer. It is generally the upper, sunlit portion of a dense canopy. The LAI values for various crops differ widely but values of 3-5 are common for many mature crops. For a given crop, green LAI changes throughout the season and normally reaches its maximum before or at flowering (Figure 8). LAI further depends on the plant density and the crop variety. The bulk stomatal resistance, rl, is the average resistance of an individual leaf. This resistance is crop specific and differs among crop varieties and crop management. It usually increases as the crop ages and begins to ripen. There is, however, a lack of consolidated information on changes in rl over time for the different crops. The information available in the literature on stomatal conductance or resistance is often oriented toward physiological or ecophysiological studies. The stomatal resistance, rl, is influenced by climate and by water availability. However, influences vary from one crop to another and different varieties can be affected differently.

    "heading": "REFERENCE SURFACE",
    "text": "To obviate the need to define unique evaporation parameters for each crop and stage of growth, the concept of a reference surface was introduced. Evapotranspiration rates of the various crops are related to the evapotranspiration rate from the reference surface (ETo) by means of crop coefficients. In the past, an open water surface has been proposed as a reference surface. However, the differences in aerodynamic, vegetation control and radiation characteristics present a strong challenge in relating ET to measurements of free water evaporation. Relating ETo to a specific crop has the advantage of incorporating the biological and physical processes involved in ET from cropped surfaces. Grass, together with alfalfa, is a well-studied crop regarding its aerodynamic and surface characteristics and is accepted worldwide as a reference surface. Because the resistance to diffusion of vapour strongly depends on crop height, ground cover, LAI and soil moisture conditions, the characteristics of the reference crop should be well defined and fixed. Changes in crop height result in variations in the roughness and LAI. Consequently, the associated canopy and aerodynamic resistances will vary appreciably with time. Moreover, water stress and the degree of ground cover have an effect on the resistances and also on the albedo. To avoid problems of local calibration which would require demanding and expensive studies, a hypothetical grass reference has been selected. Difficulties with a living grass reference result from the fact that the grass variety and morphology can significantly affect the evapotranspiration rate, especially during peak water use. Large differences may exist between warm-season and cool-season grass types. Cool-season grasses have a lower degree of stomatal control and hence higher rates of evapotranspiration. It may be difficult to grow cool-season grasses in some arid, tropical climates.\nThe FAO Expert Consultation on Revision of FAO Methodologies for Crop Water Requirements accepted the following unambiguous definition for the reference surface:\n\"A hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0.12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m-1 and an albedo of 0.23.\"\nThe reference surface closely resembles an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively growing, completely shading the ground and with adequate water. The requirements that the grass surface should be extensive and uniform result from the assumption that all fluxes are one-dimensional upwards.\nThe FAO Penman-Monteith method is selected as the method by which the evapotranspiration of this reference surface (ETo) can be unambiguously determined, and as the method which provides consistent ETo values in all regions and climates."

By defining the reference crop as a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m-1 and an albedo of 0.23, closely resembling the evaporation of an extension surface of green grass of uniform height, actively growing and adequately watered, the FAO Penman-Monteith method was developed. The method overcomes shortcomings of the previous FAO Penman method and provides values more consistent with actual crop water use data worldwide.\nFrom the original Penman-Monteith equation (Equation 3) and the equations of the aerodynamic (Equation 4) and surface resistance (Equation 5), the FAO Penman-Monteith method to estimate ETo can be derived (Box 6):\n)u34.01(\n)ee(u 273T 900)GR(408.0 ET\n2\nas2n\no +γ+∆\n− + γ+−∆ = (6)\nwhere ETo reference evapotranspiration [mm day-1],\nRn net radiation at the crop surface [MJ m-2 day-1], G soil heat flux density [MJ m-2 day-1], T mean daily air temperature at 2 m height [°C], u2 wind speed at 2 m height [m s-1], es saturation vapour pressure [kPa], ea actual vapour pressure [kPa], es-ea saturation vapour pressure deficit [kPa], ∆ slope vapour pressure curve [kPa °C-1], γ psychrometric constant [kPa °C-1].\nCrop evapotranspiration\n25\nThe reference evapotranspiration, ETo, provides a standard to which:\n• evapotranspiration at different periods of the year or in other regions can be compared; • evapotranspiration of other crops can be related.\nThe equation uses standard climatological records of solar radiation (sunshine), air temperature, humidity and wind speed. To ensure the integrity of computations, the weather measurements should be made at 2 m (or converted to that height) above an extensive surface of green grass, shading the ground and not short of water.\nNo weather-based evapotranspiration equation can be expected to predict evapotranspiration perfectly under every climatic situation due to simplification in formulation and errors in data measurement. It is probable that precision instruments under excellent environmental and biological management conditions will show the FAO Penman-Monteith equation to deviate at times from true measurements of grass ETo. However, the Expert Consultation agreed to use the hypothetical reference definition of the FAO Penman-Monteith equation as the definition for grass ETo when deriving and expressing crop coefficients.\nIt is important, when comparing the FAO Penman-Monteith equation to ETo measurements, that the full Penman-Monteith equation (Equation 3) and associated equations for ra and rs (Equations 4 and 5) be used to enable accounting for variation in ET due to variation in height of the grass measured. Variations in measurement height can significantly change LAI, d and zom and the corresponding ETo measurement and predicted value. When evaluating results, it should be noted that local environmental and management factors, such as watering frequency, also affect ETo observations.\nThe FAO Penman-Monteith equation is a close, simple representation of the physical and physiological factors governing the evapotranspiration process. By using the FAO PenmanMonteith definition for ETo, one may calculate crop coefficients at research sites by relating the measured crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with the calculated ETo, i.e., Kc = ETc/ETo. In the crop coefficient approach, differences in the crop canopy and aerodynamic resistance relative to the hypothetical reference crop are accounted for within the crop coefficient. The"

Procedures for estimating missing climatic data are outlined in Chapter 3. Differences between ETo values obtained with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation with, on the one hand, a limited data set and, on the other hand, a full data set, are expected to be smaller than or of similar magnitude to the differences resulting from the use of an alternative ETo equation.\nEven where the data set contains only maximum and minimum air temperature it is still possible to obtain reasonable estimates of ten-day or monthly ETo with the FAO PenmanMonteith equation.

This can be done for weather stations with full data sets by comparing ETo calculated with full and with limited data sets. The ratio should be close to one. Where the ratio deviates significantly from one, the ratio can be used as a correction factor for estimates made with the limited data set. Where the standard error of estimate exceeds 20% of the mean ETo, a sensitivity analysis should be performed to determine causes (and limits) for the method utilized to import the missing data.

The evapotranspiration demand is high in hot dry weather due to the dryness of the air and the amount of energy available as direct solar radiation and latent heat.

The shelters are designed to protect the instruments from direct exposure to solar heating. The louvered construction allows free air movement around the instruments.

Minimum and maximum thermometers record the minimum and maximum air temperature over a 24-hour period. Thermographs plot the instantaneous temperature over a day or week. Electronic weather stations often sample air temperature each minute and report hourly averages in addition to 24-hour maximum and minimum values.\nDue to the non-linearity of humidity data required in the FAO Penman-Monteith equation, the vapour pressure for a certain period should be computed as the mean between the vapour pressure at the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of that period.

Conversion factors between various units and Pa are given in Annex 1.

In this handbook, vapour pressure is expressed in kilopascals (kPa = 1 000 Pa).\nWhen air is enclosed above an evaporating water surface, an equilibrium is reached between the water molecules escaping and returning to the water reservoir. At that moment, the air is said to be saturated since it cannot store any extra water molecules. The corresponding pressure is called the saturation vapour pressure (eo(T) ). The number of water molecules that can be stored in the air depends on the temperature (T). The higher the air temperature, the higher the storage capacity, the higher its saturation vapour pressure (Figure 11). As can be seen from Figure 11, the slope of the curve changes exponentially with temperature. At low temperatures, the slope is small and varies only slightly as the temperature rises. At high temperatures, the slope is large and small changes in T result in large changes in slope.

The measurement is based on the nature of some material such as hair, which changes its length in response to changes in air humidity, or using a capacitance plate, where the electric capacitance changes with RH. Vapour pressure can be measured indirectly with psychrometers which measure the temperature difference between two thermometers, the so-called dry and wet bulb thermometers. The dry bulb thermometer measures the temperature of the air. The bulb of the wet bulb thermometer is covered with a constantly saturated wick. Evaporation of water from the wick, requiring energy, lowers the temperature of the thermometer. The drier the air, the larger the evaporative cooling and the larger the temperature drop. The difference between the dry and wet bulb temperatures is called the wet bulb depression and is a measure of the air humidity.\nThe dewpoint temperature is measured with dewpoint meters. The underlying principle of some types of apparatus is the cooling of the ambient air until dew formation occurs. The corresponding temperature is the dewpoint temperature.\nMeteorological data 36\nRelative humidity and dewpoint temperature data are notoriously plagued by measurement errors. Measurement error is common for both older hygrothermograph types of instruments and for the more modern electronic instruments. These instruments are described in Annex 5. Great care should be made to assess the accuracy and integrity of RH and dewpoint data. The user is encouraged to always compare computed dewpoint temperatures to daily minimum air temperatures, as described at the end of this chapter and in Annexes 5 and 6. Frequently, it is better to utilize a dewpoint temperature that is predicted from daily minimum air temperature, rather than to use unreliable relative humidity measurements. The user is encouraged to utilize good judgement in this area."

This angle will change during the day and will be different at different latitudes and in different seasons. The solar radiation received at the top of the earth's atmosphere on a horizontal surface is called the extraterrestrial (solar) radiation, Ra.\nIf the sun is directly overhead, the angle of incidence is zero and the extraterrestrial radiation is 0.0820 MJ m-2 min-1. As seasons change, the position of the sun, the length of the day and, hence, Ra change as well. Extraterrestrial radiation is thus a function of latitude, date and time of day.

    "heading": "ESTIMATING MISSING CLIMATIC DATA",
    "text": "The assessment of the reference evapotranspiration ETo with the Penman-Monteith method is developed in Chapter 4. The calculation requires mean daily, ten-day or monthly maximum and minimum air temperature (Tmax and Tmin), actual vapour pressure (ea), net radiation (Rn) and wind speed measured at 2 m (u2). If some of the required weather data are missing or cannot be calculated, it is strongly recommended that the user estimate the missing climatic data with one of the following procedures and use the FAO Penman-Monteith method for the calculation of ETo. The use of an alternative ETo calculation procedure, requiring only limited meteorological parameters, is less recommended. Procedures to estimate missing humidity, radiation and wind speed data are given in this section. Estimating missing humidity data\nWhere humidity data are lacking or are of questionable quality, an estimate of actual vapour pressure, ea, can be obtained by assuming that dewpoint temperature (Tdew) is near the daily minimum temperature (Tmin). This statement implicitly assumes that at sunrise, when the air temperature is close to Tmin, that the air is nearly saturated with water vapour and the relative humidity is nearly 100%. If Tmin is used to represent Tdew then:\n+ == 3.237T T27.17 exp611.0)T(ee min min min o a (48)\nThe relationship Tdew ≈ Tmin holds for locations where the cover crop of the station is\nwell watered. However, particularly for arid regions, the air might not be saturated when its temperature is at its minimum. Hence, Tmin might be greater than Tdew and a further calibration may be required to estimate dewpoint temperatures. In these situations, “Tmin” in the above equation may be better approximated by subtracting 2-3°C from Tmin. Appropriate correction procedures are given in Annex 6. In humid and subhumid climates, Tmin and Tdew measured in early morning may be less than Tdew measured during the daytime because of condensation of dew during the night. After sunrise, evaporation of the dew will once again\nCrop evapotranspiration\n59\nhumidify the air and will increase the value measured for Tdew during the daytime. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 5.4 of Annex 5. However, it is standard practice in 24- hour calculations of ETo to use Tdew measured or calculated durin early morning.\nThe estimate for ea from Tmin should be checked. When the prediction by Equation 48 is validated for a region, it can be used for daily estimates of ea. Estimating missing radiation data\nNet radiation measuring devices, requiring professional control, have rarely been installed in agrometeorological stations. In the absence of a direct measurement, longwave and net radiation can be derived from more commonly observed weather parameters, i.e., solar radiation or sunshine hours, air temperature and vapour pressure. Where solar radiation is not measured, it can perhaps be estimated from measured hours of bright sunshine. However, where daily sunshine hours (n) are not available, solar radiation data cannot be computed with the calculation procedures previously presented. This section presents various methods to estimate solar radiation data with an alternative methodology. Solar Radiation data from a nearby weather station\nThis method relies on the fact that for the same month and often for the same day, the variables affecting incoming solar radiation, Rs, and sunshine duration, n, are similar throughout a given region. This implies that: (i) the size of the region is small; (ii) the air masses governing rainfall and cloudiness are nearly identical within parts of the region; and (iii) the physiography of the region is almost homogenous. Differences in relief should be negligible as they strongly influence the movement of air masses. Under such conditions, radiation data observed at nearby stations can be used.\nCaution should be used when applying this method to mountainous and coastal areas where differences in exposure and altitude could be important or where rainfall is variable due to convective conditions. Moreover, data from a station located nearby but situated on the other side of a mountain may not be transferable as conditions governing radiation are different. The user should observe climatic conditions in both locations and obtain information from local persons concerning general differences in cloud cover and type.\nWhere the north-south distance to a weather station within the same homogeneous region exceeds 50 km so that the value for Ra changes, the Rs measurement should be adjusted using the ratio of the solar to extraterrestrial radiation, Rs/Ra:\na reg,a reg,s s RR\nR R = (49)\nwhere Rs,reg solar radiation at the regional location [MJ m-2 day-1], Ra,reg extraterrestrial radiation at the regional location [MJ m-2 day-1].\nOnce the solar radiation has been derived from the radiation data of a nearby station, the\nnet longwave radiation (Equation 39) and the net radiation (Equation 40) can be calculated.\nThe estimation method of Equation 49 is recommended for monthly calculations of ETo. If using the method for daily estimates of ETo, a more careful analysis of weather data in the importing and exporting meteorological stations has to be performed to verify whether both\nMeteorological data 60\nstations are in the same homogeneous climatic region and are close enough to experience similar conditions within the same day. The analysis should include the comparison of daily weather data from both stations, particularly the maximum and minimum air temperature and humidity. In fact, similar cloudiness and sunshine durations are related to similarities in temperature and humidity trends.\nGenerally, daily calculations of ETo with estimated radiation data are justified when utilized as a sum or an average over a several-day period. This is the case for the computation of the mean evapotranspiration demand between successive irrigations or when planning irrigation schedules. Under these conditions, the relative error for one day often counterbalances the error for another day of the averaging period. Daily estimates should not be utilized as true daily estimates but only in averages over the period under consideration. Solar Radiation data derived from air temperature differences\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum air temperature is related to the degree of cloud cover in a location. Clear-sky conditions result in high temperatures during the day (Tmax) because the atmosphere is transparent to the incoming solar radiation and in low temperatures during the night (Tmin) because less outgoing longwave radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere. On the other hand, in overcast conditions, Tmax is relatively smaller because a significant part of the incoming solar radiation never reaches the earth's surface and is absorbed and reflected by the clouds. Similarly, Tmin will be relatively higher as the cloud cover acts as a blanket and decreases the net outgoing longwave radiation. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum air temperature (Tmax - Tmin) can be used as an indicator of the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation that reaches the earth's surface. This principle has been utilized by Hargreaves and Samani to develop estimates of ETo using only air temperature data.\nThe Hargreaves’ radiation formula, adjusted and validated at several weather stations in a variety of climate conditions, becomes:\naR)minTmax(TRsksR −= (50)\nwhere Ra extraterrestrial radiation [MJ m-2 d-1], Tmax maximum air temperature [°C], Tmin minimum air temperature [°C], kRs adjustment coefficient (0.16 .. 0.19) [°C-0.5].\nThe square root of the temperature difference is closely related to the existing daily solar radiation in a given location. The adjustment coefficient kRs is empirical and differs for ‘interior’ or ‘coastal’ regions:\n• for ‘interior’ locations, where land mass dominates and air masses are not strongly influenced by a large water body, kRs ≅ 0.16; • for ‘coastal’ locations, situated on or adjacent to the coast of a large land mass and where air masses are influenced by a nearby water body, kRs ≅ 0.19.\nThe relationship between Rs/Ra and the temperature difference is plotted in Figure 17 for interior and coastal locations. The fraction of extraterrestrial radiation that reaches the earth's surface, Rs/Ra, ranges from about 0.25 on a day with dense cloud cover to about 0.75 on a\nCrop evapotranspiration\n61\ncloudless day with clear sky. Rs predicted by Equation 50 should be limited to ≤ Rso from Equation 36 or 37.\nThe temperature difference method is recommended for locations where it is not appropriate to import radiation data from a regional station, either because homogeneous climate conditions do not occur, or because data for the region are lacking. For island conditions, the methodology of Equation 50 is not appropriate due to moderating effects of the surrounding water body.\nCaution is required when daily computations of ETo are needed. The advice given for Equation 49 fully applies. It is recommended that daily estimates of ETo that are based on estimated Rs be summed or averaged over a several-day period, such as a week, decade or month to reduce prediction error.\nEXAMPLE 15 Determination of solar radiation from temperature data Determine the solar radiation from the temperature data of July in Lyon (France) at a latitude of 45°43'N and at 200 m above sea level.

The temperature method is not appropriate for this situation. Where radiation data from another location on the island are not available, a first estimate of the monthly solar average can be obtained from the empirical relation:\nwhere Rs solar radiation [MJ m-2 day-1],\nRa extraterrestrial radiation [MJ m-2 day-1], b empirical constant, equal to 4 MJ m-2 day-1.\nThis relationship is only applicable for low altitudes (from 0 to 100 m). The empirical constant represents the fact that in island locations some clouds are usually present, thus making the mean solar radiation 4 MJ m-2 day-1 below the nearly clear sky envelope (0.7 Ra). Local adjustment of the empirical constant may improve the estimation.\nbR7.0R as −= (51)\nCrop evapotranspiration\n63\nThe method is only appropriate for monthly calculations. The constant relation between Rs and Ra does not yield accurate daily estimates. Missing wind speed data\nWind speed data from a nearby weather station\nImporting wind speed data from a nearby station, as for radiation data, relies on the fact that the air flow above a ‘homogeneous’ region may have relatively large variations through the course of a day but small variations when referring to longer periods or the total for the day. Data from a nearby station may be imported where air masses are of the same origin or where the same fronts govern air flows in the region and where the relief is similar. When importing wind speed data from another station, the regional climate, trends in variation of other meteorological parameters and relief should be compared. Strong winds are often associated with low relative humidity and light winds are common with high relative humidity. Thus, trends in variation of daily maximum and minimum relative humidities should be similar in both locations. In mountainous areas, data should not necessarily be imported from the nearest station but from nearby stations with similar elevation and exposure to the dominant winds. The paired stations may even vary from one season to another, depending on the dominant winds. Imported wind speed data can be used when making monthly estimates of evapotranspiration. Daily calculations are justified when utilized as a sum or average over a several-day period, such as a week or decade. Empirical estimates of monthly wind speed\nAs the variation in wind speed average over monthly periods is relatively small and fluctuates around average values, monthly values of wind speed may be estimated. The ‘average’ wind speed estimates may be selected from information available for the regional climate, but should take seasonal changes into account. General values are suggested in Table 4.\nTABLE 4 General classes of monthly wind speed data\nDescription\nmean monthly wind speed at 2 m\nlight wind light to moderate wind moderate to strong wind strong wind\n... ≤ 1.0 m/s\n1 – 3 m/s 3 – 5 m/s\n... ≥ 5.0 m/s Where no wind data are available within the region, a value of 2 m/s can be used as a temporary estimate. This value is the average over 2 000 weather stations around the globe. In general, wind speed at 2 m, u2, should be limited to about u2 ≥ 0.5 m/s when used in the ETo equation (Equation 6). This is necessary to account for the effects of boundary layer instability and bouyancy of air in promoting exchange of vapour at the surface when air is calm. This effect occurs when the wind speed is small and buoyancy of warm air induces air exchange at the surface. Limiting u2 ≥ 0.5 m/s in the ETo equation improves the estimation accuracy under the conditions of very low wind speed.\nMeteorological data 64"

As an alternative, ETo can be estimated using the Hargreaves ETo equation where: a 5.0 minmaxmeano R)TT()8.17T(0023.0ET −+= (52)\nwhere all parameters have been previously defined. Units for both ETo and Ra in Equation 52 are mm day-1. Equation 52 should be verified in each new region by comparing with estimates by the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (Equation 6) at weather stations where solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed are measured. If necessary, Equation 52 can be calibrated on a monthly or annual basis by determining empirical coefficients where ETo = a + b ETo Eq.52, where the “Eq. 52” subscript refers to ETo predicted using Equation 52. The coefficients a and b can be determined by regression analyses or by visual fitting. In general, estimating solar radiation, vapor pressure and wind speed as described in Equations 48 to 51 and Table 4 and then utilizing these estimates in Equation 6 (the FAO Penman-Monteith equation) will provide somewhat more accurate estimates as compared to estimating ETo directly using Equation 52. This is due to the ability of the estimation equations to incorporate general climatic characteristics such as high or low wind speed or high or low relative humidity into the ETo estimate made using Equation 6.\nEquation 52 has a tendency to underpredict under high wind conditions (u2 > 3 m/s) and to overpredict under conditions of high relative humidity.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n65\nChapter 4\nDetermination of ETo This chapter demonstrates how the crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is determined either from meteorological data or from pan evaporation.\nThe FAO Penman-Monteith method is maintained as the sole standard method for the computation of ETo from meteorological data. The method itself is introduced in Chapter 2, and the computation of all data required for the calculation of ETo is discussed in Chapter 3. This chapter presents guidelines to calculate ETo with different time steps, ranging from hours to months, and with missing climatic data. The ETo calculation can be done by hand with the help of a calculation sheet, or by means of a computer.\nETo can also be estimated from the evaporation loss from a water surface. The procedure to obtain ETo from pan evaporation and the coefficients for different types of pans are presented in this chapter."

The extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) and daylight hours (N) for a specific day of the month can be computed using Equations 21 and 34 or can be selected from Tables 2.5 and 2.6 in Annex 2.\nWhen the soil is warming (spring) or cooling (autumn), the soil heat flux (G) for monthly\nperiods may become significant relative to the mean monthly Rn. In these cases G cannot be ignored and its value should be determined from the mean monthly air temperatures of the previous and next month.

As the magnitude of daily soil heat flux (G) beneath the reference grass surface is relatively small, it may be ignored for 24-hour time steps.\nEXAMPLE 18 Determination of ETo with daily data Given the meteorological data as measured on 6 July in Uccle (Brussels, Belgium) located at 50°48’N and at 100 m above sea level: - - - - - - Maximum air temperature (Tmax) = Minimum air temperature (Tmin) = Maximum relative humidity (RHmax) = Minimum relative humidity (RHmin) = Wind speed measured at 10 m height = Actual hours of sunshine (n) = 21.5 12.3 84 63 10 9.25 °C °C % % km/h hours\nConversion of wind speed At 10 m height From Eq. 47, with z = 10 m: Wind speed = 10 km/h or uz = At standard height, u2 = 0.748 (2.78) =\n2.78\n2.078 m/s m/s\nParameters From Eq. 7, for:\naltitude = P =\n100 100.1 m kPa\n-\nTmean = (21.5 + 12.3)/2 =\n16.9 °C\nFrom Eq. 13, for:\nTmean = ∆ =\n16.9 0.122 °C kPa/°C\nFrom Eq. 8, for:\nP = γ =\n100.1 0.0666 kPa kPa/°C\n-\n(1 + 0.34 u2) =\n1.71 -\n- -\n∆/[∆+γ(1+0.34u2)] = 0.122/[(0.122 + 0.0666 (1.71)] =\n0.518 -\n- -\nγ/[∆+γ(1+0.34u2)] = 0.0666/[0.122 + 0.0666 (1.71)] =\n0.282 -\n-\n900/(Tmean+273) u2 =\n6.450 -\nCrop evapotranspiration\n73\nVapour pressure deficit From Eq. 11, for: Then: Tmax = e°(Tmax) =\n21.5 2.564 °C kPa\nFrom Eq. 11, for: Then:\nTmin = e°(Tmin) =\n12.3 1.431 °C kPa\n-\nes = (2.564 + 1.431) =\n1.997 kPa\nGiven relative humidity data\nRHmax = RHmin =\n84 63 % %\nFrom Eq. 17: ea = [1.431 (0.84) + 2.564 (0.63)]/2 = 1.409 kPa -\nVapour pressure deficit (es-ea) = (1.997 - 1.409) =\n0.589 kPa\nRadiation From Table 2.5: Month 7, Day = 6\nJ =\n187 -\nFrom Eq. 21: Latitude = 50°48’N = J = Ra =\n50.80 187 41.09 °N - MJ m-2 day-1\nFrom Eq. 34:\nLatitude = 50°48’N = J = N = 16.1 n/N = 9.25/16.3 =\n50.80 187\n16.1 0.57 °N - hours -\nFrom Eq. 35 From Eq. 37 - From Eq. 38\nRs = [0.25 + 0.50 (0.57)] 41.09 Rso = (0.75 + 2 (100)/100 000) 41.09 = Rs/Rso = Rns = 0.77 (22.07) =\n22.07 30.90\n0.71 17.00 MJ m-2 day-1 MJ m-2 day-1 - MJ m-2 day-1\nFor: Then: For: Then: -\nTmax = Tmax,K = 21.5 + 273.16 = σTmax,K4 = Tmin = Tmin,K = 12.3 + 273.16 = σTmin,K4 = (σTmax,K4 + σTmin,K4)/2 = (36.96 + 32.56)/2 =\n21.5 294.7 36.96\n12.3 285.5 32.56\n34.76 °C K MJ m-2 day-1 °C K MJ m-2 day-1 MJ m-2 day-1\n- -\n(0.34-0.14√ea) = (1.35(Rs/Rso)-0.35) =\n0.17 0.61 - -\nFrom Eq. 39 From Eq. 40 From Eq. 42 - -\nRnl = 34.76 (0.17) 0.61 = Rn = (17.00 - 3.71) = G = (Rn - G) = (13.28 - 0) = 0.408 (Rn-G) =\n3.71 13.28\n0 13.28\n5.42 MJ m-2 day-1 MJ m-2 day-1 MJ m-2 day-1 MJ m-2 day-1 mm/day\nGrass reference evapotranspiration - - - - 0.408 (Rn-G) ∆/[∆+γ(1+0.34u2)] = 900/(T+273) u2 (es-ea) γ/[∆+γ(1+0.34u2)] = ETo (Eq. 6) = 2.81 + 1.07 = 3.88 ≈\n2.81 1.07\n3.9 mm/day mm/day mm/day\nThe grass reference evapotranspiration is 3.9 mm/day.\nDetermination of ETo 74"

    "text": "In areas where substantial changes in wind speed, dewpoint or cloudiness occur during the day, calculation of the ETo equation using hourly time steps is generally better than using 24-hour calculation time steps. Such weather changes can cause 24-hour means to misrepresent evaporative power of the environment during parts of the day and may introduce error into the calculations. However, under most conditions, application of the FAO Penman-Monteith equation with 24-hour data produces accurate results.\nWith the advent of electronic, automated weather stations, weather data are increasingly reported for hourly or shorter periods. Therefore, in situations where calculations are computerized, the FAO Penman-Monteith equation can be applied on an hourly basis with good results. When applying the FAO Penman-Monteith equation on an hourly or shorter time scale, the equation and some of the procedures for calculating meteorological data should be adjusted for the smaller time step. The FAO Penman-Monteith equation for hourly time steps is:\n)u34.01(\n)e)T(e(u 273T\n37)GR(408.0\n2\nahr o\n2 hr n\noET +γ+∆\n− + γ+−∆ = (53)\nwhere ETo reference evapotranspiration [mm hour-1],\nRn net radiation at the grass surface [MJ m-2 hour-1] (Equation 40), G soil heat flux density [MJ m-2 hour-1] (Equations 45 and 46), Thr mean hourly air temperature [°C], ∆ saturation slope vapour pressure curve at Thr [kPa °C-1] (Equation 13), γ psychrometric constant [kPa °C-1] (Equation 8), e°(Thr) saturation vapour pressure at air temperature Thr [kPa] (Equation 11), ea average hourly actual vapour pressure [kPa] (Equation 54), u2 average hourly wind speed [m s-1].\nGiven relative humidity measurements, the actual vapour pressure is determined as:\nwhere ea average hourly actual vapour pressure [kPa], e°(Thr) saturation vapour pressure at air temperature Thr [kPa] (Equation 11), RHhr average hourly relative humidity [%].\nThe net radiation is the difference between the net shortwave radiation (Rns) and the net longwave radiation (Rnl) at the hourly time steps. Consequently:\n• If Rns and Rnl need to be calculated, the extraterrestrial radiation value (Ra) for the hourly period (Equation 28) should be used. • In the computation of Rnl by means of Equation 39, (σTmax,K4 + σTmin,K4)/2 is\nreplaced by σThr,K4 and the Stefan-Boltzman constant becomes: σ = (4.903/24) 10-9 = 2.043 10-10 MJ m-2 hour-1.\n100\nRH )T(ee hrhr o a = (54)\nCrop evapotranspiration\n75\nSince the ratio Rs/Rso is used to represent cloud cover, when calculating Rnl for hourly periods during the nighttime, the ratio Rs/Rso can be set equal to the Rs/Rso calculated for a time period occurring 2-3 hours before sunset, before the sun angle becomes small. This will generally serve as a good approximation of cloudiness occurring during the subsequent nighttime. The hourly period that is 2 to 3 hours before sunset can be identified during computation of Ra as the period where ω, calculated from Equation 31, is within the range (ωs - 0.79) ≤ ω ≤ (ωs - 0.52), where ωs is calculated using Equation 25. As a more approximate alternative, one can assume Rs/Rso = 0.4 to 0.6 during nighttime periods in humid and subhumid climates and Rs/Rso = 0.7 to 0.8 in arid and semiarid climates. A value of Rs/Rso = 0.3 presumes total cloud cover.\nSoil heat flux is important for hourly calculations. Equations 45 and 46 can be used to derive G for the hourly periods.\nThe required meteorological data consist of:\n• Air temperature: mean hourly temperature (Thr). • Air humidity: average hourly relative humidity (RHhr). • Wind speed: average hourly wind speed data measured at 2 m height (u2). • Radiation: total hourly solar (Rs) or net radiation (Rn).\nBecause of the need for standardization, the constants in Equation 53 presume a constant surface resistance (rs) of 70 s/m during all periods. This constant resistance may cause some underprediction of hourly ETo during some daytime periods when actual rs may be somewhat lower. The constant resistance may cause some overprediction of hourly ETo during evening periods when actual rs may be somewhat higher. However, when the calculations of hourly ETo from Equation 53 are summed over 24 hour periods to produce an equivalent 24-hour ETo, the hourly differences tend to compensate one another and the results are generally equivalent to calculations of ETo made on a 24-hour time step. Precise estimates of ETo for specific hourly periods may require the use of aerodynamic stability functions and functions for modifying the value for rs based on levels of radiation, humidity and temperature. Application of these functions are not normally required when hourly calculations are to be summed to 24-hour totals. Therefore, these functions are not described here.\nEXAMPLE 19 Determination of ETo with hourly data Given mean average hourly data between 02.00 and 03.00 hours and 14.00 and 15.00 hours on 1 October in N’Diaye (Senegal) at 16°13'N and 16°15'W and 8 m above sea level.

In the absence of rain, the amount of water evaporated during a period (mm/day) corresponds with the decrease in water depth in that period. Pans provide a measurement of the integrated effect of radiation, wind, temperature and humidity on the evaporation from an open water surface. Although the pan responds in a similar fashion to the same climatic factors affecting crop transpiration, several factors produce significant differences in loss of water from a water surface and from a cropped surface. Reflection of solar radiation from water in the shallow pan might be different from the assumed 23% for the grass reference surface. Storage of heat within the pan can be appreciable and may cause significant evaporation during the night while most crops transpire only during the daytime. There are also differences in turbulence, temperature and humidity of the air immediately above the respective surfaces. Heat transfer through the sides of the pan occurs and affects the energy balance.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n79\nNotwithstanding the difference between pan-evaporation and the evapotranspiration of cropped surfaces, the use of pans to predict ETo for periods of 10 days or longer may be warranted.

The pan coefficients presented apply to galvanized pans annually painted with aluminium and to stainless steel pans. Little difference in Epan will occur where the inside and outside surfaces of the pan are painted white. An increase in Epan of up to 10% may occur when they are painted black.

This is the evapotranspiration from disease-free, well-fertilized crops, grown in large fields, under optimum soil water conditions and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions. The effects of various weather conditions on evapotranspiration are incorporated into ETo (Part A). The effects of characteristics that distinguish the cropped surface from the reference surface are integrated into the crop coefficient. By multiplying ETo by the crop coefficient, ETc is determined. Typical crop coefficients, calculation procedures for adjusting the crop coefficients and for calculating ETc are presented in this part. Two calculation approaches are outlined: the single and the dual crop coefficient approach. In the single crop coefficient approach, the difference in evapotranspiration between the cropped and reference grass is combined into one single coefficient. In the dual crop coefficient approach, the crop coefficient is split into two factors describing separately the differences in evaporation and transpiration between the crop and reference surface. As discussed in Chapter 5 and summarized in Table 10, the single crop coefficient approach is used for most applications related to irrigation planning, design, and management. The dual crop coefficient approach is relevant in calculations where detailed estimates of soil water evaporation are required, such as in real time irrigation scheduling applications, water quality modelling, and in research.\n88\nCrop evapotranspiration\n89\nChapter 5\nIntroduction to crop evapotranspiration (ETc)\nThis chapter outlines the crop coefficient approach for calculating the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ETc). The standard conditions refer to crops grown in large fields under excellent agronomic and soil water conditions. The crop evapotranspiration differs distinctly from the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) as the ground cover, canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance of the crop are different from grass. The effects of characteristics that distinguish field crops from grass are integrated into the crop coefficient (Kc). In the crop coefficient approach, crop evapotranspiration is calculated by multiplying ETo by Kc.\nDifferences in evaporation and transpiration between field crops and the reference grass surface can be integrated in a single crop coefficient (Kc) or separated into two coefficients: a basal crop (Kcb) and a soil evaporation coefficient (Ke), i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke. The approach to follow should be selected as a function of the purpose of the calculation, the accuracy required and the data available."

It can also be derived from studies of the soil water balance determined from cropped fields or from lysimeters.\nCrop evapotranspiration can also be derived from meteorological and crop data by means of the Penman-Monteith equation (Eq. 3). By adjusting the albedo and the aerodynamic and canopy surface resistances to the growing characteristics of the specific crop, the evapotranspiration rate can be directly estimated. The albedo and resistances are, however, difficult to estimate accurately as they may vary continually during the growing season as climatic conditions change, as the crop develops, and with wetness of the soil surface. The canopy resistance will further be influenced by the soil water availability, and it increases strongly if the crop is subjected to water stress.\nAs there is still a considerable lack of consolidated information on the aerodynamic and canopy resistances for the various cropped surfaces, the FAO Penman-Monteith method is used in this handbook only for estimating ETo, the evapotranspiration from a well-watered hypothetical grass surface having fixed crop height, albedo and surface resistance.\nIntroduction to crop evapotranspiration (ETc) 90"

Therefore, as ETo represents an index of climatic demand, Kc varies predominately with the specific crop characteristics and only to a limited extent with climate. This enables the transfer of standard values for Kc between locations and between climates. This has been a primary reason for the global acceptance and usefulness of the crop coefficient approach and the Kc factors developed in past studies.\nThe reference ETo is defined and calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (Chapter 4). The crop coefficient, Kc, is basically the ratio of the crop ETc to the reference ETo, and it represents an integration of the effects of four primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from reference grass. These characteristics are:\n• Crop height. The crop height influences the aerodynamic resistance term, ra, of the FAO Penman-Monteith equation and the turbulent transfer of vapour from the crop into the atmosphere. The ra term appears twice in the full form of the FAO Penman-Monteith equation.\n• Albedo (reflectance) of the crop-soil surface. The albedo is affected by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and by the soil surface wetness. The albedo of the crop-soil surface influences the net radiation of the surface, Rn, which is the primary source of the energy exchange for the evaporation process.\n• Canopy resistance. The resistance of the crop to vapour transfer is affected by leaf area (number of stomata), leaf age and condition, and the degree of stomatal control. The canopy resistance influences the surface resistance, rs.\n• Evaporation from soil, especially exposed soil.\nThe soil surface wetness and the fraction of ground covered by vegetation influence the surface resistance, rs. Following soil wetting, the vapour transfer rate from the soil is high, especially for crops having incomplete ground cover. The combined surface resistance of the canopy and of the soil determines the (bulk) surface resistance, rs. The surface resistance term in the Penman-Monteith equation represents the resistance to vapour flow from within plant leaves and from beneath the soil surface.\nThe Kc in Equation 56 predicts ETc under standard conditions. This represents the upper envelope of crop evapotranspiration and represents conditions where no limitations are placed on crop growth or evapotranspiration due to water shortage, crop density, or disease, weed, insect or salinity pressures. The ETc predicted by Kc is adjusted if necessary to non-standard\nCrop evapotranspiration\n91\nconditions, ETc adj, where any environmental condition or characteristic is known to have an impact on or to limit ETc.

    "text": "Due to differences in albedo, crop height, aerodynamic properties, and leaf and stomata properties, the evapotranspiration from full grown, well-watered crops differs from ETo.\nThe close spacings of plants and taller canopy height and roughness of many full grown agricultural crops cause these crops to have Kc factors that are larger than 1. The Kc factor is often 5-10% higher than the reference (where Kc = 1.0), and even 15-20% greater for some tall crops such as maize, sorghum or sugar cane (Figure 20). Typical values for the crop coefficient for full grown crops (Kc mid) are listed in Table 12.\nCrops such as pineapples, that close their stomata during the day, have very small crop coefficients. In most species, however, the stomata open as irradiance increases. In addition to the stomatal response to environment, the position and number of the stomata and the resistance of the cuticula to vapour transfer determine the water loss from the crop. Species with stomata on only the lower side of the leaf and/or large leaf resistances will have relatively smaller Kc values. This is the case for citrus and most deciduous fruit trees. Transpiration control and spacing of the trees, providing only 70% ground cover for mature trees, may cause the Kc of those trees, if cultivated without a ground cover crop, to be smaller than one (Figure 20)."

    "text": "The Kc values of Table 12 are typical values expected for average Kc under a standard climatic condition, which is defined as a sub-humid climate with average daytime minimum relative humidity (RHmin) ≈ 45% and having calm to moderate wind speeds averaging 2 m/s. Variations in wind alter the aerodynamic resistance of the crops and hence their crop coefficients, especially for those crops that are substantially taller than the hypothetical grass reference. The effect of the difference in aerodynamic properties between the grass reference surface and agricultural crops is not only crop specific. It also varies with the climatic conditions and crop height. Because aerodynamic properties are greater for many agricultural crops as compared to the grass reference, the ratio of ETc to ETo (i.e., Kc) for many crops increases as wind speed increases and as relative humidity decreases. More arid climates and conditions of greater wind speed will have higher values for Kc. More humid climates and conditions of lower wind speed will have lower values for Kc.\nIntroduction to crop evapotranspiration (ETc) 92\nCrop evapotranspiration\n93\nThe relative impact of the climate on Kc for full grown crops is illustrated in Figure 21. The upper bounds represent extremely arid and windy conditions, while the lower bounds are valid under very humid and calm weather conditions. The ranges expected in Kc as climate and weather conditions change are quite small for short crops but are large for tall crops. Guidelines for the adjustment of Kc to the climatic conditions as a function of crop height are given in Chapter 6.\nUnder humid and calm wind conditions, Kc becomes less dependent on the differences between the aerodynamic components of ETc and ETo and the Kc values for ‘full-cover’ agricultural crops do not exceed 1.0 by more than about 0.05. This is because full-cover agricultural crops and the reference crop of clipped grass both provide for nearly maximum absorption of shortwave radiation, which is the primary energy source for evaporation under humid and calm conditions. Generally, the albedos, α, are similar over a wide range of fullcover agricultural crops, including the reference crop. Because the vapour pressure deficit (es - ea) is small under humid conditions, differences in ET caused by differences in aerodynamic resistance, ra, between the agricultural crop and the reference crop are also small, especially with low to moderate wind speed.\nUnder arid conditions, the effect of differences in ra between the agricultural crop and the grass reference crop on ETc become more pronounced because the (es - ea) term may be relatively large. The larger magnitudes of (es - ea) amplify differences in the aerodynamic term in the numerator of the Penman-Monteith equation (Equation 3) for both the crop and the reference crop. Hence, Kc will be larger under arid conditions when the agricultural crop has a leaf area and roughness height that are greater than that of the grass reference.\nBecause the 1/ra term in the numerator of the Penman-Monteith equation (Equation 3) is multiplied by the vapour pressure deficit (es - ea), the ET from tall crops increases proportionately more relative to ETo than does ET from short crops when relative humidity is low. The Kc for tall crops, such as those 2-3 m in height, can be as much as 30% higher in a windy, arid climate as compared with a calm, humid climate. The increase in Kc is due to the influence of the larger aerodynamic roughness of the tall crop relative to grass on the transport of water vapour from the surface."

The Kc coefficient for full-cover crops primarily reflects differences in transpiration as the contribution of soil evaporation is relatively small. After rainfall or irrigation, the effect of evaporation is predominant when the crop is small and scarcely shades the ground. For such low-cover conditions, the Kc coefficient is determined largely by the frequency with which the soil surface is wetted. Where the soil is wet for most of the time from irrigation or rain, the evaporation from the soil surface will be considerable and Kc may exceed 1. On the other hand, where the soil surface is dry, evaporation is restricted and Kc will be small and might even drop to as low as 0.1 (Figure 22).\nDifferences in soil evaporation between the field crop and the reference surface can be forecast more precisely by using a dual crop coefficient.\nIntroduction to crop evapotranspiration (ETc) 94\nFIGURE 22 The effect of evaporation on Kc.

The length of the initial period is highly dependent on the crop, the crop variety, the planting date and the climate.

For perennial crops, the planting date is replaced by the ‘greenup’ date, i.e., the time when the initiation of new leaves occurs.\nDuring the initial period, the leaf area is small, and evapotranspiration is predominately in the form of soil evaporation. Therefore, the Kc during the initial period (Kc ini) is large when the soil is wet from irrigation and rainfall and is low when the soil surface is dry. The time for the soil surface to dry is determined by the time interval between wetting events, the evaporation power of the atmosphere (ETo) and the importance of the wetting event. General estimates for Kc ini as a function of the frequency of wetting and ETo are given in Table 9. The data assume a medium textured soil. The procedure for estimating Kc ini is presented in Chapter 6."

    "heading": "Crop development stage",
    "text": "The crop development stage runs from 10% ground cover to effective full cover. Effective full cover for many crops occurs at the initiation of flowering. For row crops where rows commonly interlock leaves such as beans, sugar beets, potatoes and corn, effective cover can be defined as the time when some leaves of plants in adjacent rows begin to intermingle so that soil shading becomes nearly complete, or when plants reach nearly full size if no intermingling occurs. For some crops, especially those taller than 0.5 m, the average fraction of the ground surface covered by vegetation (fc) at the start of effective full cover is about 0.7-0.8. Fractions of sunlit\nIntroduction to crop evapotranspiration (ETc) 96\nand shaded soil and leaves do not change significantly with further growth of the crop beyond fc ≈ 0.7 to 0.8. It is understood that the crop or plant can continue to grow in both height and leaf area after the time of effective full cover. Because it is difficult to visually determine when densely sown vegetation such as winter and spring cereals and some grasses reach effective full cover, the more easily detectable stage of heading (flowering) is generally used for these types of crops.\nFor dense grasses, effective full cover may occur at about 0.10-0.15 m height. For thin stands of grass (dry rangeland), grass height may approach 0.3-0.5 m before effective full cover is reached. Densely planted forages such as alfalfa and clover reach effective full cover at about 0.3-0.4 m.\nAnother way to estimate the occurrence of effective full cover is when the leaf area index (LAI) reaches three. LAI is defined as the average total area of leaves (one side) per unit area of ground surface.\nAs the crop develops and shades more and more of the ground, evaporation becomes more restricted and transpiration gradually becomes the major process. During the crop development stage, the Kc value corresponds to amounts of ground cover and plant development. Typically, if the soil surface is dry, Kc = 0.5 corresponds to about 25-40% of the ground surface covered by vegetation due to the effects of shading and due to microscale transport of sensible heat from the soil into the vegetation. A Kc = 0.7 often corresponds to about 40-60% ground cover. These values will vary, depending on the crop, frequency of wetting and whether the crop uses more water than the reference crop at full ground cover (e.g., depending on its canopy architecture and crop height relative to clipped grass)."

The start of maturity is often indicated by the beginning of the ageing, yellowing or senescence of leaves, leaf drop, or the browning of fruit to the degree that the crop evapotranspiration is reduced relative to the reference ETo. The mid-season stage is the longest stage for perennials and for many annuals, but it may be relatively short for vegetable crops that are harvested fresh for their green vegetation.\nAt the mid-season stage the Kc reaches its maximum value. The value for Kc (Kc mid) is relatively constant for most growing and cultural conditions. Deviation of the Kc mid from the reference value '1' is primarily due to differences in crop height and resistance between the grass reference surface and the agricultural crop and weather conditions."

The Kc end value is high if the crop is frequently irrigated until harvested fresh. If the crop is allowed to senesce and to dry out in the field before harvest, the Kc end value will be small. Senescence is usually associated with less efficient stomatal conductance of leaf surfaces due to the effects of ageing, thereby causing a reduction in Kc.\nFigure 24 illustrates the variation in Kc for different crops as influenced by weather factors and crop development."

The difference can be combined into one single coefficient, or it can be split into two factors describing separately the differences in evaporation and transpiration between both surfaces. The selection of the approach depends on the purpose of the calculation, the accuracy required, the climatic data available and the time step with which the calculations are executed. Table 10 presents the general selection criteria.\nIntroduction to crop evapotranspiration (ETc) 98\nSingle and dual crop coefficient approaches\nSingle crop coefficient approach (Kc )\nIn the single crop coefficient approach, the effect of crop transpiration and soil evaporation are combined into a single Kc coefficient. The coefficient integrates differences in the soil evaporation and crop transpiration rate between the crop and the grass reference surface. As soil evaporation may fluctuate daily as a result of rainfall or irrigation, the single crop coefficient expresses only the time-averaged (multi-day) effects of crop evapotranspiration.\nAs the single Kc coefficient averages soil evaporation and transpiration, the approach is used to compute ETc for weekly or longer time periods, although calculations may proceed on a daily time step. The time-averaged single Kc is used for planning studies and irrigation system design where the averaged effects of soil wetting are acceptable and relevant. This is the case for surface irrigation and set sprinkler systems where the time interval between successive irrigation is of several days, often ten days or more. For typical irrigation management, the time-averaged single Kc is valid. Dual crop coefficient approach (Kcb + Ke )\nIn the dual crop coefficient approach, the effects of crop transpiration and soil evaporation are determined separately. Two coefficients are used: the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) to describe plant transpiration, and the soil water evaporation coefficient (Ke) to describe evaporation from the soil surface. The single Kc coefficient is replaced by:\necbc KKK += (57) where Kcb basal crop coefficient,\nKe soil water evaporation coefficient.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n99\nThe basal crop coefficient, Kcb, is defined as the ratio of ETc to ETo when the soil surface layer is dry but where the average soil water content of the root zone is adequate to sustain full plant transpiration. The Kcb represents the baseline potential Kc in the absence of the additional effects of soil wetting by irrigation or precipitation. The soil evaporation coefficient, Ke, describes the evaporation component from the soil surface. If the soil is wet following rain or irrigation, Ke may be large. However, the sum of Kcb and Ke can never exceed a maximum value, Kc max, determined by the energy available for evapotranspiration at the soil surface. As the soil surface becomes drier, Ke becomes smaller and falls to zero when no water is left for evaporation. The estimation of Ke requires a daily water balance computation for the calculation of the soil water content remaining in the upper topsoil.\nThe dual coefficient approach requires more numerical calculations than the procedure using the single time-averaged Kc coefficient. The dual procedure is best for real time irrigation scheduling, for soil water balance computations, and for research studies where effects of dayto-day variations in soil surface wetness and the resulting impacts on daily ETc, the soil water profile, and deep percolation fluxes are important. This is the case for high frequency irrigation with microirrigation systems or lateral move systems such as centre pivots and linear move systems."

The largest difference between Kc and Kcb is found in the initial growth stage where evapotranspiration is predominantly in the form of soil evaporation and crop transpiration is still small. Because crop canopies are near or at full ground cover during the mid-season stage, soil evaporation beneath the canopy has less effect on crop evapotranspiration and the value for Kcb in the mid-season stage will be nearly the same as Kc. Depending on the ground cover, the basal crop coefficient during the mid-season may be only 0.05-0.10 lower than the Kc value. Depending on the frequency with which the crop is irrigated during the late season stage, Kcb will be similar to (if infrequently irrigated) or less than the Kc value.\nFigure 26 presents typical shapes for the Kcb, Ke and single Kc curves. The Kcb curve in the figure represents the minimum Kc for conditions of adequate soil water and dry soil surface. The Ke ‘spikes’ in the figure represent increased evaporation when precipitation or irrigation has wetted the soil surface and has temporarily increased total ETc. These wet soil evaporation spikes decrease as the soil surface layer dries. The spikes generally reach a maximum value of 1.0-1.2, depending on the climate, the magnitude of the wetting event and the portion of soil surface wetted.\nSummed together, the values for Kcb and for Ke represent the single crop coefficient, Kc. The total Kc curve, shown as the dashed line in Figure 26, illustrates the effect of averaging Kcb + Ke over time and is displayed as a ‘smoothed’ curve. It is this smoothed curve that is represented by the single Kc calculation procedure. The Kc curve lies above the Kcb curve, with potentially large differences during the initial and development stages, depending on the frequency of soil wetting."

In Chapter 6, a single time-averaged crop coefficient is used to calculate ETc. The approach using two coefficients to describe the effects of crop and soil separately is outlined in Chapter 7. Figure 27 presents the general calculation procedures.\nIntroduction to crop evapotranspiration (ETc) 102\nCrop evapotranspiration\n103\nChapter 6\nETc – single crop coefficient (Kc)\nThis chapter deals with the calculation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) under standard conditions. No limitations are placed on crop growth or evapotranspiration from soil water and salinity stress, crop density, pests and diseases, weed infestation or low fertility. ETc is determined by the crop coefficient approach whereby the effect of the various weather conditions are incorporated into ETo and the crop characteristics into the Kc coefficient:\nThe effect of both crop transpiration and soil evaporation are integrated into a single crop\ncoefficient. The Kc coefficient incorporates crop characteristics and averaged effects of evaporation from the soil. For normal irrigation planning and management purposes, for the development of basic irrigation schedules, and for most hydrologic water balance studies, average crop coefficients are relevant and more convenient than the Kc computed on a daily time step using a separate crop and soil coefficient (Chapter 7). Only when values for Kc are needed on a daily basis for specific fields of crops and for specific years, must a separate transpiration and evaporation coefficient (Kcb + Ke) be considered.\nThe calculation procedure for crop evapotranspiration, ETc, consists of:"

See footnote 24 of Table 12 for additional information,\nwhere the Kc continues outside of the “growing period”. Primary source: FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977), Table 22.\nThe lengths of the initial and development periods may be relatively short for deciduous trees and shrubs that can develop new leaves in the spring at relatively fast rates (Figure 23).\nThe rate at which vegetation cover develops and the time at which it attains effective full cover are affected by weather conditions in general and by mean daily air temperature in particular. Therefore, the length of time between planting and effective full cover will vary with climate, latitude, elevation and planting date. It will also vary with cultivar (crop variety). Generally, once the effective full cover for a plant canopy has been reached, the rate of further phenological development (flowering, seed development, ripening, and senescence) is more dependent on plant genotype and less dependent on weather. As an example, Figure 28 presents the variation in length of the growing period for one cultivar of rice for one region and for various planting dates.\nThe end of the mid-season and beginning of the late season is usually marked by senescence of leaves, often beginning with the lower leaves of plants. The length of the late season period may be relatively short (less than 10 days) for vegetation killed by frost (for example, maize at high elevations in latitudes > 40°N) or for agricultural crops that are harvested fresh (for example, table beets and small vegetables). High temperatures may accelerate the ripening and senescence of crops. Long duration of high air temperature (> 35°C) can cause some crops such as turf grass to go into dormancy. If severely high air temperatures are coupled with moisture stress, the dormancy of grass can be permanent for the remainder of the growing season. Moisture stress or other environmental stresses will usually accelerate the rate of crop maturation and can shorten the mid and late season growing periods.\nThe values in Table 11 are useful only as a general guide and for comparison purposes. The listed lengths of growth stages are average lengths for the regions and periods specified and are intended to serve only as examples. Local observations of the specific plant stage development should be used, wherever possible, to incorporate effects of plant variety, climate and cultural practices. Local information can be obtained by interviewing farmers, ranchers, agricultural extension agents and local researchers, by conducting local surveys, or by remote sensing. When determining stage dates from local observations, the guidelines and visual descriptions may be helpful.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n109"

The trends in Kc during the growing period are represented in the crop coefficient curve.

The coefficients presented are organized by group type (i.e., small vegetables, legumes, cereals, etc.) to assist in locating the crop in the table and to aid in comparing crops within the same group. There is usually close similarity in the coefficients among the members of the same crop group, as the plant height, leaf area, ground coverage and water management are normally similar.\nThe coefficients in Table 12 integrate the effects of both transpiration and evaporation over time. The effects of the integration over time represent an average wetting frequency for a 'standard' crop under typical growing conditions in an irrigated setting. The values for Kc during the initial and crop development stages are subject to the effects of large variations in wetting frequencies and therefore refinements to the value used for Kc ini should always be made. For frequent wettings such as with high frequency sprinkler irrigation or rainfall, the values for Kc ini may increase substantially.\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 110\nwettings such as with high frequency sprinkle irrigation or daily rainfall, these values may increase substantially and may approach 1.0 to 1.2. Kc ini is a function of wetting interval and potential evaporation rate during the initial and development periods and is more accurately estimated using Figures 29 and 30, or Equation 7-3 in Annex 7, or using the dual Kcb ini + Ke. 2 Beans, Peas, Legumes, Tomatoes, Peppers and Cucumbers are sometimes grown on stalks reaching 1.5 to 2 meters in height. In such cases, increased Kc values need to be taken. For green beans, peppers and cucumbers, 1.15 can be taken, and for tomatoes, dry beans and peas, 1.20. Under these conditions h should be increased also. 3 The midseason values for cassava assume non-stressed conditions during or following the rainy season. The Kc end values account for dormancy during the dry season. 4 The Kc end value for potatoes is about 0.40 for long season potatoes with vine kill. 5 This Kc end value is for no irrigation during the last month of the growing season. The Kc end value for sugar beets is higher, up to 1.0, when irrigation or significant rain occurs during the last month.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n111\nTable 12 continued Crop\nKc ini\n1\nKc mid\nKc end\nMaximum Crop Height\n(h) (m)\ne.

It is applied to the period following the first development period until the beginning of the last late season period of the growing season. 14 These Kc coefficients for hay crops represent immediately following cutting; at full cover; and immediately before cutting, respectively. The growing season is described as a series of individual cutting periods (Figure 35). 15 Cool season grass varieties include dense stands of bluegrass, ryegrass, and fescue. Warm season varieties include bermuda grass and St. Augustine grass. The 0.95 values for cool season grass represent a 0.06 to 0.08 m mowing height under general turf conditions. Where careful water management is practiced and rapid growth is not required, Kc's for turf can be reduced by 0.10. 16 The pineapple plant has very low transpiration because it closes its stomates during the day and opens them during the night. Therefore, the majority of ETc from pineapple is evaporation from the soil. The Kc mid < Kc ini since Kc mid occurs during full ground cover so that soil evaporation is less. Values given assume that 50% of the ground surface is covered by black plastic mulch and that irrigation is by sprinkler. For drip irrigation beneath the plastic mulch, Kc's given can be reduced by 0.10. 17 Includes the water requirements of the shade trees.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n113\nTable 12 continued Crop\nKc ini\n1\nKc mid\nKc end\nMaximum Crop Height\n(h) (m)\nn.

After leaf drop, Kc end ≈ 0.20 for bare, dry soil\nor dead ground cover and Kc end ≈ 0.50 to 0.80 for actively growing ground cover (consult Chapter 11).\n19 Refer to Eq. 94, 97 or 98 and footnotes 21 and 22 for estimating Kc for immature stands. 20 Stone fruit category applies to peaches, apricots, pears, plums and pecans. 21 These Kc values can be calculated from Eq. 98 for Kc min = 0.15 and Kc full = 0.75, 0.70 and 0.75\nfor the initial, mid season and end of season periods, and fc eff = fc where fc = fraction of ground covered by tree canopy (e.g., the sun is presumed to be directly overhead). The values listed correspond with those in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) and with more recent measurements. The midseason value is lower than initial and ending values due to the effects of stomatal closure during periods of peak ET. For humid and subhumid climates where there is less stomatal control by citrus, values for Kc ini, Kc mid, and Kc end can be increased by 0.1 - 0.2, following Rogers et al. (1983). 22 These Kc values can be calculated as Kc = fc Kc ngc + (1 - fc) Kc cover where Kc ngc is the Kc of citrus with no active ground cover (calculated as in footnote 21), Kc cover is the Kc for the active ground cover (0.95), and fc is defined in footnote 21. The values listed correspond with those in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) and with more recent measurements. Alternatively, Kc for citrus with active ground cover can be estimated directly from Eq. 98 by setting Kc min = Kc cover. For humid and subhumid climates where there is less stomatal control by citrus, values for Kc ini, Kc mid, and Kc end can be increased by 0.1 - 0.2, following Rogers et al. (1983).\nFor non-active or only moderately active ground cover (active indicates green and growing ground cover with LAI > about 2 to 3) , Kc should be weighted between Kc for no ground cover and Kc for active ground cover, with the weighting based on the \"greenness\" and approximate leaf area of the ground cover. 23 Confers exhibit substantial stomatal control due to reduced aerodynamic resistance. The Kc can easily reduce below the values presented, which represent well-watered conditions for large forests.\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 114\nTable 12 continued Crop\nKc ini\n1\nKc mid\nKc end\nMaximum Crop Height\n(h) (m)\no.

Refer to Eq. 98 and footnotes 21 and\n22 for estimating Kc for immature stands. In Spain, Pastor and Orgaz (1994) have found the following monthly Kc‘s for olive orchards having 60% ground cover: 0.50, 0.50, 0.65, 0.60, 0.55, 0.50, 0.45, 0.45, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.50 for months January through December. These coefficients can be invoked by using Kc ini = 0.65, Kc mid = 0.45, and Kc end = 0.65, with stage lengths = 30, 90, 60 and 90 days, respectively for initial, development, midseason and late season periods, and using Kc during the winter (“off season”) in December to February = 0.50. 25 These Kc's are for deep water in temperate latitudes where large temperature changes in the water body occur during the year, and initial and peak period evaporation is low as radiation energy is absorbed into the deep water body. During fall and winter periods (Kc end), heat is released from the water body that increases the evaporation above that for grass. Therefore, Kc mid corresponds to the period when the water body is gaining thermal energy and Kc end when releasing thermal energy. These Kc's should be used with caution.\nPrimary sources: Kc ini: Doorenbos and Kassam (1979)\nKc mid and Kc end: Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977); Pruitt (1986); Wright (1981, 1982), Snyder et al., (1989)\nThe values for Kc mid and Kc end in Table 12 represent those for a sub-humid climate with an average daytime minimum relative humidity (RHmin) of about 45% and with calm to moderate wind speeds averaging 2 m/s. For more humid or arid conditions, or for more or less windy conditions, the Kc coefficients for the mid-season and end of late season stage should be modified as described in this chapter.\nThe values for Kc in Table 12 are values for non-stressed crops cultivated under excellent agronomic and water management conditions and achieving maximum crop yield (standard conditions). Where stand density, height or leaf area are less than that attained under such conditions, the value for Kc mid and, for most crops, for Kc end will need to be modified (Part C, Chapters 8, 9 and 10).

More accurate estimates of Kc ini can be obtained by considering: Time interval between wetting events\nEvapotranspiration during the initial stage for annual crops is predominately in the form of evaporation. Therefore, accurate estimates for Kc ini should consider the frequency with which the soil surface is wetted during the initial period.

Time interval between wetting events\nIn general, the mean time interval between wetting events is estimated by counting all rainfall and irrigation events occurring during the initial period that are greater than a few millimetres. Wetting events occurring on adjacent days can be counted as one event. The mean wetting interval is estimated by dividing the length of the initial period by the number of events.\nWhere only monthly rainfall values are available without any information on the number of rainy days, the number of events within the month can be estimated by dividing the monthly rainfall depth by the depth of a typical rain event. The typical depth, if it exists, can vary widely from climate to climate, region to region and from season to season. Table 13 presents some information on the range of rainfall depths. After deciding what rainfall is typical for the region and time of the year, the number of rainy days and the mean wetting interval can be estimated.\nwhere irrigation is not yet developed, the mean interval between the future irrigations should be\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 116\nestimated to obtain the required frequency of wetting necessary to keep the crop stress free.

Light wetting events (infiltration depths of 10 mm or less): rainfall and high frequency irrigation systems\nFigure 29 is used for all soil types when wetting events are light. When wetting during the initial period is only by precipitation, one will usually use Figure 29 to determine Kc ini. The graph can also be used when irrigation is by high frequency systems such as microirrigation and centre pivot and light applications of about 10 mm or less per wetting event are applied.\nEXAMPLE 24 Graphical determination of Kc ini\nA silt loam soil receives irrigation every two days during the initial growth stage via a centre pivot irrigation system. The average depth applied by the centre pivot system is about 12 mm per event and the average ETo during the initial stage is 4 mm/day. Estimate the crop evapotranspiration during that stage. From Fig. 29 using the 2-day interval curve:\nKc ini =\n0.85 -\n- ETc = Kc ETo = 0.85 (4.0) = 3.4 mm/day The average crop evapotranspiration during the initial growth stage is 3.4 mm/day\nHeavy wetting events (infiltration depths of 40 mm or more): surface and sprinkler irrigation Figure 30 is used for heavy wetting events when infiltration depths are greater than 40 mm, such as for when wetting is primarily by periodic irrigation such as by sprinkler or surface irrigation. Following a wetting event, the amount of water available in the topsoil for evaporation is considerable, and the time for the soil surface to dry might be significantly increased. Consequently, the average Kc factor is larger than for light wetting events. As the time for the soil surface to dry is, apart from the evaporation power and the frequency of wetting, also determined by the water storage capacity of the topsoil, a distinction is made between soil types.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n117\nFigure 30a is used for coarse textured soils and Figure 30b is used for fine and medium textured soils.

For example, for a trickle irrigation system, the fraction of the surface wetted, fw, may be only 0.4. For furrow irrigation systems, the fraction of the surface wetted may range from 0.3 to 0.8. Common values for the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation or precipitation are given in Table 20. When only a fraction of the soil surface is wetted, the value for Kc ini obtained from Table 12 or from Figures 29 or 30 should be multiplied by the fraction of the surface wetted to adjust for the partial wetting: Fig),(Tabinicwinic KfK = (60) where fw the fraction of surfaced wetted by irrigation or rain [0 - 1],\nKc ini (Tab,Fig) the value for Kc ini from Table 12 or Figure 29 or 30.\nIn addition, in selecting which figure to use (i.e., Figure 29 or 30), the average infiltrated depth, expressed in millimetres over the entire field surface, should be divided by fw to represent the true infiltrated depth of water for the part of the surface that is wetted (Figure 31):\nw\nw f II = (61)\nwhere Iw irrigation depth for the part of the surface that is wetted [mm], fw fraction of surface wetted by irrigation, I the irrigation depth for the field [mm].\nWhen irrigation of part of the soil surface and precipitation over the entire soil surface\nboth occur during the initial period, fw should represent the average of fw for each type of wetting, weighted according to the total infiltration depth received by each type.\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 120\nEXAMPLE 26 Determination of Kc ini for partial wetting of the soil surface Determine the evapotranspiration of the crop in Example 24 if it had been irrigated using a trickle system every two days (with 12 mm each application expressed as an equivalent depth over the field area), and where the average fraction of surface wet was 0.4, and where little or no precipitation occurred during the initial period.

Moreover, under the common condition where Tmin approaches Tdew (i.e., RHmax ≈ 100%), the vapour pressure deficit (es - ea), with es from Equation 12 and ea from Equation 17, becomes [(100-RHmin)/200] e°(Tmax), where e°(Tmax) is saturation vapour pressure at maximum daily air temperature. This indicates that RHmin better reflects the impact of vapour pressure deficit on Kc than does RHmean.\nRHmin is calculated on a daily or average monthly basis as:\n100 )T(e\n)T(e RH\nmax o\ndew o\nmin = (63)\nwhere Tdew is mean dewpoint temperature and Tmax is mean daily maximum air temperature during the mid-season growth stage. Where dewpoint temperature or other hygrometric data are\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 124\nnot available or are of questionable quality, RHmin can be estimated by substituting mean daily minimum air temperature, Tmin, for Tdew1. Then:\n100 )T(e\n)T(e RH\nmax o\nmin o\nmin = (64)\nThe values for u2 and RHmin need only be approximate for the mid-season growth stage. This is because Equation 62 is not strongly sensitive to these values, changing 0.04 per 1 m/s change in u2 and per 10% change in RHmin for a 3 m tall crop. Measurements, calculation and estimation of missing wind and humidity data are provided in Chapter 3. Wind speed measured at other than 2 m height should be adjusted to reflect values for wind speed at 2 m over grass using Equation 47. Where no data on u2 or RHmin are available, the general classification for wind speed and humidity data given in Tables 15 and 16 can be used.\nEquation 62 is valid for mean plant heights up to 10 m. For plant heights smaller than 0.1 m, vegetation will behave aerodynamically similar to grass reference and eq. 62 should not be applied. Example values for h are listed in Table 12 for various crops. However, the mean plant height will greatly vary with crop variety and with cultural practices. Therefore, wherever possible, h should be obtained from general field observations. However, the presence of the 0.3 exponent in Equation 62 makes these equations relatively insensitive to small errors in the value used for h. Generally, a single value for h is used to represent the mid-season period."

For frequent irrigation of crops (more frequently than every 3 days) and where the Kc mid of Table 12 is less than 1.0, the value can be replaced by approximately 1.1-1.3 to account for the combined effects of continuously wet soil, evaporation due to interception (sprinkler irrigation) and roughness of the vegetation, especially where the irrigation system moistens an important fraction of the soil surface (fw > 0.3).\n1 In the case of arid and semi-arid climates, Tmin in equation (64) should be adjusted as indicated in\nAnnex 6 (equation 6-6) by subtracting 2°C from the average value of Tmin to better approximate Tdew.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n125\nEXAMPLE 27 Determination of Kc mid Calculate Kc mid for maize crops near Taipei, Taiwan and near Mocha, Yemen. The average mean daily wind speed (u2) during the mid-season stage at Taipei is about 1.3 m/s and the minimum relative humidity (RHmin) during this stage averages 75%. The average u2 during the mid-season near Mocha is 4.6 m/s and the RHmin during this stage averages 44%. From Table 12, the value for Kc mid is 1.20 for maize. The value for h from Table 12 is 2 m.

The values given for Kc end reflect crop and water management practices particular to those crops. If the crop is irrigated frequently until harvested fresh, the topsoil remains wet and the Kc end value will be relatively high. On the other hand, crops that are allowed to senesce and dry out in the field before harvest receive less frequent irrigation or no irrigation at all during the late season stage. Consequently, both the soil surface and vegetation are dry and the value for Kc end will be relatively small (Figure 33).\nWhere the local water management and harvest timing practices are known to deviate from the typical values presented in Table 12, then the user should make some adjustments to the values for Kc end. Some guidance on adjustment of Kc values for wetting frequency is provided in Chapter 7. For premature harvest, the user can construct a Kc curve using the Kc end value provided in Table 12 and a late season length typical of a normal harvest date; but can then terminate the application of the constructed curve early, corresponding to the time of the early harvest.\nThe Kc end values in Table 12 are typical values expected for average Kc end under the\nstandard climatic conditions. More arid climates and conditions of greater wind speed will have higher values for Kc end. More humid climates and conditions of lower wind speed will have lower values for Kc end. For specific adjustment in climates where RHmin differs from 45% or where u2 is larger or smaller than 2.0 m/s, Equation 65 can be used:\n[ ] 3.0\nmin2)Tab(endcendc 3 h)45RH(004.0)2u(04.0KK −−−+= (65)\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 126\nCrop evapotranspiration\n127\nwhere Kc end (Tab) value for Kc end taken from Table 12, u2 mean value for daily wind speed at 2 m height over grass during the late season growth stage [m s-1], for 1 m s-1 ≤ u2 ≤ 6 m s-1, RHmin mean value for daily minimum relative humidity during the late season stage [%],for 20% ≤ RHmin ≤ 80%, h mean plant height during the late season stage [m], for 0.1 m ≤ h\n≤ 10 m.\nEquation 65 is only applied when the tabulated values for Kc end exceed 0.45. The equation reduces the Kc end with increasing RHmin. This reduction in Kc end is characteristic of crops that are harvested ‘green’ or before becoming completely dead and dry (i.e., Kc end ≥ 0.45).\nNo adjustment is made when Kc end (Table) < 0.45 (i.e., Kc end = Kc end (Tab)). When\ncrops are allowed to senesce and dry in the field (as evidenced by Kc end < 0.45), u2 and RHmin have less effect on Kc end and no adjustment is necessary. In fact, Kc end may decrease with decreasing RHmin for crops that are ripe and dry at the time of harvest, as lower relative humidity accelerates the drying process. CONSTRUCTION OF THE Kc CURVE"

Each harvest essentially terminates a ‘sub’ growing season and associated Kc curve and initiates a new ‘sub’ growing season and associated Kc curve. The resulting Kc curve for the entire growing season is the aggregation of a series of Kc curves associated with each subcycle. Figure 35 presents a Kc curve for the entire growing season constructed for alfalfa grown for hay in southern Idaho.\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 128\nIn the southern Idaho climate, greenup (leaf initiation) begins in the spring on about day 90 of the year. The crop is usually harvested (cut) for hay three or four times during the growing season. Therefore, Figure 35 shows four Kc sub-cycles or cutting cycles: sub-cycle 1 follows greenup in the spring and the three additional Kc sub-cycles follow cuttings. Cuttings create a ground surface with less than 10% vegetation cover. Cutting cycle 1 is longer in duration than cycles 2, 3 and 4 due to lower air and soil temperatures during this period that reduce crop growth rates. The lengths for cutting cycle 1 were taken from the first entry for alfalfa (“1st cutting cycle”) in Table 11 for Idaho, the United States (10/30/25/10). The lengths for cutting cycles 2, 3 and 4 were taken from the entry for alfalfa in Table 11 for “individual cutting periods” for Idaho, the United States (5/20/10/10). These lengths were based on observations. In the southern Idaho climate, frosts terminate the growing season sometime in the fall, usually around day 280-290 of the year (early to mid-October).\nThe magnitudes of the Kc values during the mid-season periods of each cutting cycle shown in Figure 35 vary from cycle to cycle due to the effects of adjusting the values for Kc mid and Kc end for each cutting cycle period using Equations 62 and 65. In applying these two adjustment equations, the u2 and RHmin values were averages for the mid-season and late season stages within each cutting cycle. Basal Kcb curves similar to Figure 35 can be constructed for forage or hay crops, following procedures presented in Chapter 7."

The value used for Kc mid under these averaged conditions may be only about 80% of the Kc value that represents full ground cover. These averaged, full-season Kc mid values are listed in Table 12.

As the mid and late season stages of deciduous trees are quite long, the specific adjustment of Kc to RHmin and u2 should take into account the varying climatic conditions throughout the season. Therefore, several adjustments of Kc are often required if the mid and late seasons cover several climatic seasons, e.g., spring, summer and autumn or wet and dry seasons. The Kc ini and Kc end for evergreen non dormant trees and shrubs are often not different, where climatic conditions do not vary much, as happens in tropical climates.

Assuming that all decades have a duration of 10 days facilitates the derivation of Kc and introduces little error into the calculation of ETc.\nThe constructed Kc curve in Box 15 was used to construct the curve in Figure 36. This curve has been overlaid with the lengths of the decades. Kc values of 0.15, 1.19 and 0.35 and the actual lengths for growth stages equal to 25, 25, 30 and 20 days were used. The crop was planted at the beginning of the last decade of May and was harvested 100 days later at the end of August.\nFor all decades the Kc values can be derived directly from the curve. The value at the middle of the decade is considered to be the average Kc of that 10 day period.

The initial, development, mid-season and late season stage lengths are taken from Table 11 for a continental climate as 20, 30, 40 and 20 days (the stage lengths listed for southern Idaho were not used in this example in order to demonstrate the only approximate accuracy of values provided in Table 11 when values for the specific location are not available). Initial values for Kc ini, Kc mid and Kc end are selected from Table 12 as 0.4, 1.15, and 0.35. The mean RHmin and u2 during both the mid-season and late season growth stages were 30% and 2.2 m/s. The maximum height suggested in Table 12 for dry beans is 0.4 m. Therefore, Kc mid is adjusted using Eq. 62 as:\n[ ] 19.1 3 4.0)4530(004.0)22.2(04.015.1K\n3.0 midc = −−−+=\nAs Kc end = 0.35 is less than 0.45, no adjustment is made to Kc end. The value for Kc mid is not significantly different from that in Table 12 as u2 ≈ 2 m/s, RHmin is just 15% lower than the 45% represented in Table 12, and the height of the beans is relatively short. The initial Kc curve for dry beans in Idaho can be drawn, for initial, planning purposes, as shown in the graph (dotted line), where Kc ini, Kc mid and Kc end are 0.4, 1.19, and 0.35 and the four lengths of growth stages are 20, 30, 40 and 20 days. Note that the Kc ini = 0.4 taken from Table 12 serves only as an initial, approximate estimate for Kc ini.\n140 160 180 200 220 240 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6\n0\n40\n80\n120\n160\n200\nday of the Year\nMeasured\ncr op\nc oe\nffi ci\nen t\nI\nP\nII\nI\nII I\nP\nprecipitation and irrigation (m m\n)\nConstructed Kc curves using values from Tables 11 and 12 directly (dotted line) and modified using Kc ini from Fig. 29 and Lini = 25, Ldev = 25, Lmid = 30, and Llate = 20 days (heavy line) for dry beans at Kimberly, Idaho. Also shown are daily measured Kc (lysimeter data from Wright, 1990).\nCrop evapotranspiration\n131\nKc ini can be more accurately estimated using the approach described in this chapter. ETo during the initial period at Kimberly (late May - early June, 1974) averaged 5.3 mm/day, and the wetting interval during this period was approximately 14 days (2 rainfall events occurred averaging 5 mm per event). Therefore, as the wetting events were light (< 10 mm each), Fig. 29 is used. The soil texture at Kimberly, Idaho is silt loam. From Fig. 29, Kc ini for the 14 day wetting interval and ETo = 5.3 mm/day is about 0.15. This value is substantially less than the general 0.4 value suggested by Table 12, and emphasizes the need to utilize local, actual precipitation and irrigation data when determining Kc ini.\nComparison of constructed curves with measurements\nBecause the ETc data for the dry bean crop at Kimberly, Idaho were measured using a precision lysimeter system during 1974 by Wright (1990), the actual Kc measurements can be compared with the constructed Kc curves, where actual Kc was calculated by dividing lysimeter measurements of ETc by daily ETo estimated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation.\nAs illustrated in the graph, the mid-season length as taken from Table 11 for the general, continental climate overestimated the true mid-season length for dry beans in southern Idaho, which averaged only about 30 days rather than 40 days as suggested by Table 11. This illustrates the importance of using the local observation of 30 days for mid-season period length rather than the general value from Table 11.\nThe final, best estimate for the Kc curve for the dry bean crop in southern Idaho is plotted (lower curve in graph) using Kc values of 0.15, 1.19, and 0.35 and the actual observed lengths of growth stages equal to 25, 25, 30 and 20 days. Note the impact that the error in estimating mid-season length has on the area under the Kc curve. This supports the need to obtain local observations of growth stage dates and lengths.\nThe value calculated for Kc mid (1.19) appears to have underestimated the measured value for Kc during portions of the mid-season period at Kimberly. Some of this effect was due to effects of increased soil water evaporation following four irrigations during the 1974 mid-season which increased the effective Kc. This is illustrated in Box 16, where the basal Kcb + Ke approach is introduced and demonstrated for this same example.\nThe 0.15 value calculated for Kc ini using Fig. 29 agrees closely with measured Kc during the initial period. Measured Kc during the development period exceeded the final Kc curve during days on or following wetting events. The day to day variation in the lysimeter measured Kc is normal and is caused by day to day variations in weather, in wind direction, by errors in prediction of Rn and ETo, and by some random errors in the lysimeter measurements and weather measurements.\nETc -–single crop coefficient (Kc) 132\nDuring the first five days of that decade, Kc = 0.15, while during the second part of the decade Kc varies from 0.15 to 0.36 at the end of day 10. The Kc for that decade is consequently: 5/10 (0.15) + 5/10 (0.15+0.36)/2 = 0.20."

Similarly adjustments in Kc mid to compensate for differences in aerodynamic roughness and leaf area, as introduced in Equation 62 are derived from the Kc values given for different wind and RHmin conditions in the concerned Kc table in FAO-24, with some upward adjustment to better reflect increased ETcrop values under high wind and low RHmin when applied with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation.\nThe Kc’s from FAO-24 were based primarily on a living grass reference crop.

After leaf drop, Kcb end ≈ 0.15 for bare, dry soil or dead ground cover and Kcb end ≈ 0.45 to 0.75 for actively growing ground cover (consult Chapter 11). 20 Refer to Eq. 94, 97 or 98 and footnotes 22 and 23 for estimating Kcb for immature stands. 21 Stone fruit category applies to peaches, apricots, pears, plums and pecans. 22 These Kcb values can be calculated from Eq. 98 for Kc min = 0.15 and Kcb full = 0.70, 0.65 and\n0.70 for the initial, mid season and end of season periods, and fc eff = fc where fc = fraction of ground covered by tree canopy (e.g., the sun is presumed to be directly overhead). The midseason value is lower than initial and ending values due to the effects of stomatal closure during periods of peak ET. For humid and subhumid climates where there is less stomatal control by citrus, values for Kcb ini, Kcb mid, and Kcb end can be increased by 0.1 - 0.2, following Rogers et al. (1983). 23 These Kcb values can be calculated as Kcb = fc Kcb ngc + (1 - fc) Kcb cover where Kcb ngc is the Kcb of citrus with no active ground cover (calculated as in footnote 22), Kcb cover is the Kcb for the active ground cover (0.90), and fc is defined in footnote 22. Alternatively, Kcb for citrus with active ground cover can be estimated directly from Eq. 98 by setting Kc min = Kcb cover. For humid and subhumid climates where there is less stomatal control by citrus, values for Kcb ini, Kcb mid, and Kcb end can be increased by 0.1 - 0.2, following Rogers et al. (1983).\nFor non-active or only moderately active ground cover (active indicates green and growing ground cover with LAI > about 2 to 3) , Kcb should be weighted between Kcb for no ground cover and Kcb for active ground cover, with the weighting based on the \"greeness\" and approximate leaf area of the ground cover. 24 Conifers exhibit substantial stomatal control due to reduced aerodynamic resistance. The Kcb can easily reduce below the values presented, which represent well-watered conditions for large forests. 25 These coefficients represent about 40 to 60% ground cover.

This requirement suggests that wet soil will always increase the value for Kcb by 0.05 following complete wetting of the soil surface, even during periods of full ground cover. A value of 1.2 instead of 1 is used for Kc max in Equation 72 because of the effect of increased aerodynamic roughness of surrounding crops during development, mid-season and late season growth stages which can increase the turbulent transfer of vapour from the exposed soil surface. The “1.2” coefficient also reflects the impact of the reduced albedo of wet soil and the contribution of heat stored in dry soil prior to the wetting event. All of these factors can contribute to increased evaporation relative to the reference.\nETc -–dual crop coefficient (Kc = Kcb + Ke) 144\nThe “1.2” coefficient in Equation 72 represents effects of wetting intervals that are greater than 3 or 4 days. If irrigation or precipitation events are more frequent, for example daily or each two days, then the soil has less opportunity to absorb heat between wettings, and the “1.2” coefficient in Equation 72 can be reduced to about 1.1. The time step to compute Kc max may vary from daily to monthly. Soil evaporation reduction coefficient (Kr)\nSoil evaporation from the exposed soil can be assumed to take place in two stages: an energy limiting stage, and a falling rate stage. When the soil surface is wet, Kr is 1. When the water content in the upper soil becomes limiting, Kr decreases and becomes zero when the total amount of water that can be evaporated from the topsoil is depleted. Maximum amount of water that can be evaporated\nIn the simple evaporation procedure, it is assumed that the water content of the evaporating layer of the soil is at field capacity, θFC, shortly following a major wetting event and that the soil can dry to a soil water content level that is halfway between oven dry (no water left) and wilting point, θWP. The amount of water that can be depleted by evaporation during a complete drying cycle can hence be estimated as:\neWPFC Z)5.0(1000TEW θ−θ= (73) where TEW total evaporable water = maximum depth of water that can be\nevaporated from the soil when the topsoil has been initially completely wetted [mm],\nθFC soil water content at field capacity [m3 m-3], θWP soil water content at wilting point [m3 m-3], Ze depth of the surface soil layer that is subject to drying by way of\nevaporation [0.10-0.15 m]. Where unknown, a value for Ze, the effective depth of the soil evaporation layer, of 0.10- 0.15 m is recommended. Typical values for θFC, θWP and TEW are given in Table 19.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n145\nStage 1: energy limiting stage At the start of a drying cycle, following heavy rain or irrigation, the soil water content in the topsoil is at field capacity and the amount of water depleted by evaporation, De, is zero. During stage 1 of the drying process, the soil surface remains wet and it is assumed that evaporation from soil exposed to the atmosphere will occur at the maximum rate limited only by energy availability at the soil surface. This stage holds until the cumulative depth of evaporation, De, is such that the hydraulic properties of the upper soil become limiting and water cannot be transported to the soil surface at a rate that can supply the potential demand. During stage 1 drying, Kr = 1.\nThe cumulative depth of evaporation, De, at the end of stage 1 drying is REW (Readily evaporable water, which is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the topsoil layer without restriction during stage1). The depth normally ranges from 5 to 12 mm and is generally highest for medium and fine textured soils. Typical values for REW are given in\nTable 19.\nStage 2: falling rate stage The second stage (where the evaporation rate is reducing) is termed the ‘falling rate stage’ evaporation and starts when De exceeds REW. At this point, the soil surface is visibly dry, and the evaporation from the exposed soil decreases in proportion to the amount of water remaining in the surface soil layer:\nETc -–dual crop coefficient (Kc = Kcb + Ke) 146\nREWTEW\n1-i,eDTEW rK\n−\n− = for De,i-1 > REW (74)\nwhere Kr dimensionless evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on the soil\nwater depletion (cumulative depth of evaporation) from the topsoil layer (Kr = 1 when De,i-1 ≤ REW),\nDe,i-1 cumulative depth of evaporation (depletion) from the soil surface layer at the end of day i-1 (the previous day) [mm], TEW maximum cumulative depth of evaporation (depletion) from the soil surface layer when Kr = 0 (TEW = total evaporable water) [mm], REW cumulative depth of evaporation (depletion) at the end of stage 1 (REW = readily evaporable water) [mm].\nEXAMPLE 31 Determination of the evapotranspiration from a bare soil Determine the evapotranspiration from a bare loamy soil surface (Kcb ≈ 0.15) for ten successive days following a heavy rain.

Since the soil in this situation is bare, one could set the Kcb equal to zero so that maximum Ke becomes Ke = Kc max = 1.20. Then all of the evaporation would be deducted from the surface soil layer.\nThe example demonstrates that the estimation of Kr requires a daily water balance calculation. This is further developed in the section on the daily calculation of Ke.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n147\nExposed and wetted soil fraction (few)\nfew: calculation procedure\nIn crops with incomplete ground cover, evaporation from the soil often does not occur uniformly over the entire surface, but is greater between plants where exposure to sunlight occurs and where more air ventilation is able to transport vapour from the soil surface to above the canopy. This is especially true where only part of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation.\nIt is recognized that both the location and the fraction of the soil surface exposed to sunlight change to some degree with the time of day and depending on row orientation. The procedure presented here predicts a general averaged fraction of the soil surface from which the majority of evaporation occurs. Diffusive evaporation from the soil beneath the crop canopy is assumed to be largely included in the basal Kcb coefficient.\nWhere the complete soil surface is wetted, as by precipitation or sprinkler, then the fraction of soil surface from which most evaporation occurs, few, is essentially defined as (1- fc), where fc is the average fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation and (1-fc) is the approximate fraction of soil surface that is exposed. However, for irrigation systems where only a fraction of the ground surface is wetted, few must be limited to fw, the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation (Figure 39). Therefore, few is calculated as:\n( )wcew f,f1minf −= (75) where 1-fc average exposed soil fraction not covered (or shaded) by vegetation [0.01 - 1], fw average fraction of soil surface wetted by irrigation or precipitation [0.01 - 1].\nThe ‘min()’ function selects the lowest value of the ‘1-fc’ and ‘fw’ values. Figure 39 illustrates the relation of few to (1-fc) and fw.\nThe limitation imposed by Equation 75 assumes that the fraction of soil wetted by irrigation occurs within the fraction of soil exposed to sunlight and ventilation. This is generally the case, except perhaps with drip irrigation (Figure 39).\nIn the case of drip irrigation, where the majority of soil wetted by irrigation may be beneath the canopy and may therefore be shaded, more complex models of the soil surface and wetting patterns may be required to accurately estimate total evaporation from the soil. In this case, the value for fw may need to be reduced to about one-half to one-third of that given in Table 20 to account for the effects of shading of emitters by the plant canopy on the evaporation rate from wetted soil (Example 34). A general approach could be to multiply fw by [1-(2/3)fc] for drip irrigation. fw: fraction of soil surface wetted by irrigation or precipitation\nTable 20 presents typical values for fw. Where a mixture of irrigation and precipitation occur within the same drying period or on the same day, the value for fw should be based on a weighted average of the fw for precipitation (fw = 1) and the fw for the irrigation system. The weighting should be approximately proportional to the infiltration depths from each water source.\nETc -–dual crop coefficient (Kc = Kcb + Ke) 148\nCrop evapotranspiration\n149\ndetermine fw for that and subsequent days in a more simplified manner: • Surface is wetted by irrigation and rain: fw is the fw for the irrigation system; • Surface is wetted by irrigation: fw is the fw for the irrigation system; • Surface is wetted by significant rain (i.e., > 3 to 4 mm) with no irrigation: fw = 1; • Where there is neither irrigation nor significant precipitation: fw is the fw of the previous day. 1-fc: exposed soil fraction The fraction of the soil surface that is covered by vegetation is termed fc. Therefore, (1-fc) represents the fraction of the soil that is exposed to sunlight and air ventilation and which serves as the site for the majority of evaporation from wet soil. The value for fc is limited to < 0.99. The user should assume appropriate values for the various growth stages. Typical values for fc and (1-fc) are given in Table 21.\nWhere fc is not measured, fc can be estimated using the relationship:\n)h5.01(\nmincmaxc\nmincbc c KK\nKK f\n+\n−\n− = (76)\nwhere fc the effective fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation [0-0.99],\nKcb the value for the basal crop coefficient for the particular day or period, Kc min the minimum Kc for dry bare soil with no ground cover [≈ 0.15 - 0.20], Kc max the maximum Kc immediately following wetting (Equation 72), h mean plant height [m] .\nETc -–dual crop coefficient (Kc = Kcb + Ke) 150\nThis equation should be used with caution and validated from field observations. Kc min is the minimum crop coefficient for dry bare soil when transpiration and evaporation from the soil are near baseline (diffusive) levels. Kc min ≈ 0.15 - 0.20 is recommended. The value of Kc min is an integral part of all Kcb coefficients. Kc min ordinarily has the same value as the Kcb ini used for annual crops under nearly bare soil conditions (0.15 - 0.20).\nEquation 76 assumes that the value for Kcb is largely affected by the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation. This is a good assumption for most vegetation and conditions. The ‘1+0.5h’ exponent in the equation represents the effect of plant height on shading the soil surface and in increasing the value for Kcb given a specific value for fc. The user should limit the difference Kcb - Kc min to ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. The value for fc will change daily as Kcb changes. Therefore, the above equation is applied daily.\nApplication of Equation 76 predicts that fc decreases during the late season period in proportion to Kcb, even though the ground may remain covered with senescing vegetation. This prediction helps to account for the local transport of sensible heat from senescing leaves to the soil surface below.\nEXAMPLE 32 Calculation of the crop coefficient (Kcb + Ke) under sprinkler irrigation A field of cotton has just been sprinkler irrigated. The Kcb for the specific day (during the development period) has been computed using Table 17 and Eq. 70 and then interpolated from the Kcb curve as 0.9. The ETo = 7 mm/day, u2 = 3 m/s and RHmin = 20%. Estimate the crop coefficient (Kcb + Ke). Assuming h = 1 m, from Eq. 72, Kc max for this arid climate is:\n[ ] { } 30.105.09.0, 3 1)4520(004.0)23(04.02.1maxK\n3.0 maxc = + −−−+=\nFrom Eq. 76, where Kc min = 0.15:\nfc = [(Kcb - Kc min)/(Kc max - Kc min)](1 + 0.5h) = [(0.9 - 0.15)/(1.3 - 0.15)](1 + 0.5(1)) = 0.53.\nAs the field was sprinkler irrigated, fw = 1.0 and from Eq. 75:\nfew = min(1 - fc, fw) = min(1 - 0.53, 1.0) = 0.47. Assuming that the irrigation was sufficient to fill the evaporating layer to field capacity, so that Kr = 1, evaporation would be in stage 1. From Eq. 71: Ke = 1.00 (1.30-0.90) = 0.40 The value is compared against the upper limit few Kc max to ensure that it is less than the upper limit: few Kc max = 0.47 (1.30) = 0.61, which is greater than the value for Ke. Therefore, the value for Ke can be used with no limitation. The total Kc for the field, assuming no moisture stress due to a dry soil profile, is Kc = Kcb + Ke = 0.9 + 0.40 = 1.30. This value is large because of the very wet soil surface, the relatively tall rough crop as compared to the grass reference, and the arid climate (u2 = 3 m/s and RHmin = 20%). In this situation, Kc happens to equal Kc max, as the field has just been wetted by sprinkler irrigation.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n151\nEXAMPLE 33 Calculation of the crop coefficient (Kcb + Ke) under furrow irrigation The cotton field in the previous example (Ex. 32) has been irrigated by furrow irrigation of alternate rows rather than by sprinkler, and the fraction of the field surface wetted by the irrigation is 0.3. The few in this case is calculated from Eq. 75 as: few = min(1-fc, fw) = min(1 - 0.53, 0.3) = 0.3. Assuming that the irrigation was sufficient to fill the few portion of the evaporating layer to field capacity, so that Kr = 1, evaporation would be in stage 1. From Eq. 71: Ke = 1.00 (1.30 - 0.9) = 0.40 The value is compared to the upper limit few Kc max which is 0.30 (1.30) = 0.39. Because 0.40 > 0.39, Ke from the few surface area is constrained to 0.39. The total Kc for the furrow irrigated field, assuming no moisture stress due to dry soil, is Kc = Kcb + Ke = 0.9 + 0.39 = 1.29. This value is essentially the same as for the previous example (Ex. 32) because the procedure assumes that the soil between alternate rows is the portion that is wetted by the irrigation, so that the majority of the field surface has either vegetation cover or wet soil.\nEXAMPLE 34 Calculation of the crop coefficient (Kcb + Ke) under drip irrigation The cotton field in the previous example (Ex. 32) has been irrigated by drip irrigation, where the emitters are placed beneath the cotton canopy. The fraction of the field surface wetted by the irrigation is 0.3. The few in this case is calculated from Eq. 75 as few = min(1-fc, fw). Because the emitters are beneath the canopy so that less energy is available for evaporation, the value for fw is reduced by multiplying by 1 - (2/3)fc, so that: few = min[(1-fc),(1 - 0.67 fc) fw)] = min[(1-0.53), (1 - 0.67(0.53))(0.3)] = 0.19 Assuming that the irrigation was sufficient to fill the fw portion of the evaporating layer to field capacity, so that Kr = 1, evaporation would be in stage 1. From Eq. 71: Ke = 1.00 (1.30-0.90) = 0.40. The value is compared to the upper limit few Kc max = 0.19 (1.30) = 0.25. Because 0.25 < 0.40, Ke from the fw fraction of the surface area is constrained by the available energy. Therefore Ke = 0.25. The total Kc for the drip irrigated field, assuming no moisture stress due to dry soil, is: Kc = Kcb + Ke = 0.9 + 0.25 = 1.15. This Kc value is less than that for sprinkler and furrow irrigation (Examples 32 and 33)."

This example uses the same data set that was used in the case study of Box 15. The measured ETc data were measured using a precision lysimeter system at Kimberly, Idaho. Values for Kcb ini, Kcb mid, and Kcb end were calculated in Example 29 as 0.15, 1.14, and 0.25. The lengths of growth stages were 25, 25, 30, and 20 days. The Kcb values are plotted in Fig. 37. The value for Kc max from Eq. 72 for the mid-season period averaged 1.24, based on u2 = 2.2 m/s and RHmin = 30% for Kimberly. The soil at Kimberly was a silt loam texture. Assuming that the depth of the evaporation soil layer, Ze, was 0.1 m, values for TEW = 22 mm and REW = 9 mm, based on Eq. 73 and using soil data from Table 19. The occurrence and magnitudes of individual wetting events are shown in the figure below. Nearly all wetting events were from irrigation. Because the irrigation was by furrow irrigation of alternate rows, the value for fw was set equal to 0.5. Irrigation events occurred at about midday or during early afternoon. The agreement between the estimated values for daily Kcb+Ke (thin continuous line) and actual 24- hour measurements (symbols) is relatively good. Measured and predicted Kcb+Ke was higher following wetting by rainfall or irrigation, as expected. The two wet soil evaporation ‘spikes’ occurring during the late initial period and early development period (between days 160 and 180) were less than Kc max, because this evaporation was from wetting by furrow irrigation where fw = 0.5. The value for few was constrained to fw by Eq. 75 during these two events, because during this period, fw < 1-fc.

Field capacity is the amount of water that a well-drained soil should hold against gravitational forces, or the amount of water remaining when downward drainage has markedly decreased. In the absence of water supply, the water content in the root zone decreases as a result of water uptake by the crop. As water uptake progresses, the remaining water is held to the soil particles with greater force, lowering its potential energy and making it more difficult for the plant to extract it. Eventually, a point is reached where the crop can no longer extract the remaining water. The water uptake becomes zero when wilting point is reached. Wilting point is the water content at which plants will permanently wilt.\nETc under soil water stress conditions 162\nAs the water content above field capacity cannot be held against the forces of gravity and will drain and as the water content below wilting point cannot be extracted by plant roots, the total available water in the root zone is the difference between the water content at field capacity and wilting point: rWPFC Z)(1000TAW θ−θ= (82)\nwhere TAW the total available soil water in the root zone [mm], θFC the water content at field capacity [m3 m-3], θWP the water content at wilting point [m3 m-3], Zr the rooting depth [m].\nTAW is the amount of water that a crop can extract from its root zone, and its magnitude depends on the type of soil and the rooting depth.

Where the soil is sufficiently wet, the soil supplies water fast enough to meet the atmospheric demand of the crop, and water uptake equals ETc. As the soil water content decreases, water becomes more strongly bound to the soil matrix and is more difficult to extract. When the soil water content drops below a threshold value, soil water can no longer be transported quickly enough towards the roots to respond to the transpiration demand and the crop begins to experience stress.

When the crop evapotranspiration is low, p will be up to 20% more than the listed values. Often, a constant value is used for p for a specific growing period, rather than varying the value each day.

The rate of root water uptake is in fact influenced more directly by the potential energy level of the soil water (soil matric potential and the associated hydraulic conductivity) than by water content. As a certain soil matric potential corresponds in different soil types with different soil water contents, the value for p is also a function of the soil type. Generally, it can be stated that for fine textured soils (clay) the p values listed in Table 22 can be reduced by 5-10%, while for more coarse textured soils (sand), they can be increased by 5- 10%.\nRAW is similar to the term Management Allowed Depletion (MAD) introduced by Merriam. However, values for MAD are influenced by management and economic factors in addition to the physical factors influencing p. Generally, MAD < RAW where there is risk aversion or uncertainty, and MAD > RAW where plant moisture stress is an intentional part of soil water management."

    "heading": "EFFECTS OF SOIL SALINITY",
    "text": "Salts in the soil water solution can reduce evapotranspiration by making soil water less \"available\" for plant root extraction. Salts have an affinity for water and hence additional force is required for the crop to extract water from a saline soil. The presence of salts in the soil water solution reduces the total potential energy of the soil water solution. In addition, some salts cause toxic effects in plants and can reduce plant metabolism and growth. A function is presented here that predicts the reduction in evapotranspiration caused by salinity of soil water. The function is derived by combining yield-salinity equations from the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No29 with yield-ET equations from FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No33. The resulting equation provides a first approximation of the reduction in evapotranspiration expected under various salinity conditions.\nThere is evidence that crop yield and transpiration are not as sensitive to low osmotic potential as they are to low matric potential. Under saline conditions, many plants are able to partially compensate for low osmotic potential of the soil water by building up higher internal solute contents. This is done by absorbing ions from the soil solution and by synthesizing organic osmolytes. Both of these reactions reduce the impact of osmotic potential on water availability. However, synthesis of organic osmolytes does require expenditure of metabolic energy. Therefore plant growth is often reduced under saline conditions. The reduced plant growth impacts transpiration by reducing ground cover and is sometimes additionally due to partial stomatal closure.\nOther impacts of salts in the soil include direct sodium and chloride toxicities and induced nutrient deficiencies. These deficiencies reduce plant growth by reducing the rate of leaf elongation, the enlargement, and the division of cells in leaves. The modality depends on the method of irrigation. With sprinkler irrigation, adsorption of sodium and chloride through the leaf can result in toxic conditions for all crop species. With surface or trickle irrigaiton, direct toxic conditions generally occur only in vine and tree crops; however, high levels of sodium can induce calcium deficieincies for all crop species.\nSince salt concentration changes as the soil water content changes, soil salinity is normally measured and expressed on the basis of the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil (ECe). The ECe is defined as the electrical conductivity of the soil water solution after the addition of a sufficient quantity of distilled water to bring the soil water content to saturation. ECe is typically expressed in deciSiemens per meter (dS m-1). Under optimum management conditions, crop yields remain at potential levels until a specific, threshold electrical conductivity of the saturation soil water extract (ECe threshold) is reached. If the average ECe of the root zone increases above this critical threshold value, the yield is presumed to begin to decrease linearly in proportion to the increase in salinity. The rate of decrease in yield with increase in salinity is usually expressed as a slope, b, having units of % reduction in yield per dS/m increase in ECe.\nAll plants do not respond to salinity in a similar manner; some crops can produce acceptable yields at much higher soil salinity levels than others. This is because some crops are better able to make the needed osmotic adjustments that enable them to extract more water from a saline soil, or they may be more tolerant of some of the toxic effects of salinity. Salt tolerance for many agricultural crops are provided in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Papers No. 33 and 48. The ECe,threshold and slope b from these sources are listed in Table 23.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n175\nAs can be observed from the data in Table 23, there is an 8 to 10-fold range in salt tolerance of agricultural crops. The effect of soil salinity on yield and crop evapotranspiration is hence crop specific.\nThe ECe, threshold and b parameters in Table 23 were determined primarily in research\nexperiments using nearly steady-state irrigation where soil water contents were maintained at levels close to field capacity. However, under most types of irrigation scheduling for sprinkler and surface irrigation, the soil water content is typically depleted to well below field capacity, so that the EC of the soil water solution, ECsw, increases prior to irrigation, even though the EC of the saturation extract does not change. The increased salt concentration in the soil water solution reduces the osmotic potential of the soil water solution (it becomes more negative), so that the plant must expend more metabolic energy and may exert more mechanical force to absorb water. In addition, metabolic and toxic effects of salts on plants may become more pronounced as the soil dries and concentrations increase. However, the variation in soil water content during an irrigation interval has not been found to strongly influence crop evapotranspiration. This is because of the rise of soil water content to levels that are above that experienced under steady state irrigation early in a long irrigation interval. There is a similar, counteractive decrease in soil water content later in a long irrigation interval. In addition, the distribution of salts in the root zone under low frequency irrigation can reduce salinity impacts during the first portion of the irrigation interval. Also, under high frequency irrigation of the soil surface, soil evaporation losses are higher. Consequently, given the same application depth, the leaching fraction is reduced. For these reasons, the length of irrigation interval and the change in EC of soil water during the interval have usually not been found to be factors in the reduction of ET, given that the same depths of water are infiltrated into the root zone over time.\nIn some cases, increased evaporation under high frequency irrigation of the soil surface can counteract reductions in Kc caused by high ECe of the root zone. Under these conditions, the total Kc and ETc are not very different from the non-saline, standard conditions under less frequent irrigation, even though crop yields and crop transpiration are reduced. Because of this, under saline conditions, the Ks reducing factor should only be applied with the dual Kc approach.\nIn review articles on impacts of salinity on crop production, Letey et al. (1985) and Shalhevet (1994) concluded that effects of soil salinity and water stress are generally additive in their impacts on crop evapotranspiration. Therefore, the same yield-ET functions may hold for both water shortage induced stress and for salinity induced stress."

The approach presumes that, under optimum management conditions, crop yields remain at potential levels until a specific, threshold electrical conductivity of the soil water solution is reached. When salinity increases beyond this threshold, crop yields are presumed to decrease linearly in proportion to the increase in salinity.

However, these papers indicate that for most crops, the data are transferable to typical field situations where the readily available soil water (RAW) is depleted between irrigations."

    "heading": "Limitations",
    "text": "Because the impact of salinity on plant growth and yield and on crop evapotranspiration is a time-integrated process, generally only the seasonal value for Ky is used to predict the reduction in evapotranspiration. There are Ky values in FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper No33 for only about 23 crops. The seasonal values for Ky from paper No33 are summarized in Table 24. For many crops, the seasonal Ky is nearly 1. For crops where Ky is unknown, the user may use Ky = 1 in Equations 91 and 92 or may select the Ky for a crop type that has similar behaviour. Equations 91 and 92 are suggested as only approximate estimates of salinity impacts on ET, and represent general effects of salinity on evapotranspiration as occurring over an extended period of time (as measured in weeks or months). These equations are not expected to be accurate for predicting ETc for specific days. Nor do they include other complicating effects such as specific ion toxicity. Application of equations 91 and 92 presumes that the ECe represents the average ECe for the root zone. The equations presented may not be valid at high salinitiy, where the linear relationships between ECe, crop yield and Ks may not hold. The use of Equations 91 and 92 should usually be restricted to ECe < ECthreshold + 50/b. In addition, the equations predict Ya = 0 before Ks = 0 when Ky > 1 and vice versa.\nAs indicated earlier, reduction in ETc in the presence of soil salinity is often partially caused by reduced plant size and fraction of ground cover. These effects are largely included in the coefficient values in Table 23. Therefore, where plant growth is affected by salinity and Equations 91 and 92 are applied, no other reductions in Kc are required, for example using LAI or fraction of ground cover, as described in Chapter 9.\nETc under soil water stress conditions 178\nCrop evapotranspiration\n179\nTable 23 Continued Crop ECe, threshold\n(dS m-1) b (% / dS m-1) Rating\nf.

    "text": "Under steady state conditions, the value for ECe can be predicted as a function of EC of the irrigation water (ECiw) and the leaching fraction, using a standard leaching formula. For example, the FAO-29 leaching formula LR = ECiw / (5 ECe – ECiw) predicts the leaching requirement when approximately a 40-30-20-10 percent water extraction pattern occurs from the upper to lower quarters of the root zone prior to irrigation. ECiw is the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water. From this equation, ECe is estimated as:\n5 EC LF LF1EC iwe += (93)\nCrop evapotranspiration\n181\nwhere LF, the actual leaching fraction, is used in place of LR, the leaching requirement. Equation 93 predicts ECe = 1.5 ECiw under conditions where a 15-20 percent leaching fraction is employed. Other leaching fraction equations can be used in place of the FAO-29 equation to fit local characteristics. Equation 93 is only true if the irrigation water quality and the leaching fraction are constant over the growing season. Time is required to attain a salt equilibrium in the soil. If there are important winter rains of high quality water and often excellent leaching, the salt balance in the soil will be quite different at the beginning of the season and with a lower average ECe of the root zone than would be predicted from Equation 93. An appropriate local calibration of Equation 93 is desirable under these particular conditions.\nETc under soil water stress conditions 182\nEXAMPLE 39 Effect of soil salinity on crop evapotranspiration A field of beans is cultivated on a silt loam soil and is irrigated during the midseason period using water having salinity ECiw = 1 dS m-1. A 15 percent leaching fraction is employed. The ECe,threshold and slope from Table 23 are 1.0 dS m-1 and 19 %/(dS m-1) respectively. The seasonal Ky from FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No 33 and Table 24 for beans is Ky = 1.15. Compare the effect on crop evapotranspiration for various levels of soil water depletion in the root zone under saline and nonsaline conditions.

Non-pristine vegetation is defined, in the usage here, as vegetation having less than perfect growing conditions or stand characteristics (i.e., relatively poorer conditions of density, height, leaf area, fertility, or vitality) as compared to ‘pristine’ conditions.\nThe approach whereby a crop is characterized by a crop coefficient, Kc, and the crop evapotranspiration is given by the product of Kc and the reference evapotranspiration ETo, provides a simple and convenient way of also characterizing the evapotranspiration from natural vegetation and for non-typical cultivation practices.

As the ground cover for natural and non-pristine vegetation is often reduced, the Kc is affected to a large extent by the frequency of precipitation and/or irrigation and by the amount of leaf area and ground cover. Dual crop coefficient approach\nThe determination of Kc for natural, non-typical or non-pristine vegetation should ordinarily follow the approach described in Chapter 7 whereby separate transpiration (Kcb) and evaporation (Ke) coefficients are used. The effects of evaporation from the soil surface can be directly estimated as such.\nETc for natural, non-typical and non-pristine vegetation 184\nTwo procedures that can be used to adjust the basal crop coefficient (Kcb mid adj) for sparse vegetation are presented in this section. In these approaches, Kcb mid adj is estimated either from LAI (Equation 97) or from effective ground cover (Equation 98). After the determination of Kcb mid adj, the soil evaporation coefficient, Ke, should be determined to obtain the crop coefficient for the mid-season stage: Kc mid adj = Kcb mid adj + Ke. Procedures for calculating Ke are presented in Chapter 7.\nEven where the estimated Kcb mid adj is small, the total Kc adj (= Kcb adj + Ke) following precipitation may sometimes be as high or higher than the Kc for pristine vegetation due to surface evaporation from among sparse vegetation. Single crop coefficient approach\nWhen the single crop coefficient Kc of Chapter 6 is used, the average effects of soil wetting are incorporated into a general mean Kc. Some guidelines for the estimation of Kc adj are given in the following sections. The single crop coefficient can also be derived from the adjusted Kcb by considering the frequency of soil wetting, i.e., during the midseason period, Kc adj = Kcb adj + 0.05 for infrequent wetting and Kcb adj + 0.10 for wettings of up to once a week. For more frequent wettings, the dual crop coefficient approach should be used.\nAlternatively, Equations 97 and 98 can be used to determine Kc instead of Kcb. Then, Kc min in Equations 97 and 98 can be set equal to Kc ini, where Kc ini is estimated from Figure 29 or 30. The use of Kc ini incorporates effects of soil evaporation and therefore serves as a lower limit on the estimate for Kc mid."

The height of the tomato crop was 0.75 m. The typical percentage of ground cover for tomatoes at effective full cover at Davis is 85 to 90% and corresponds to the Kcb mid listed in Table 17 for tomatoes. The mean values for wind speed and minimum relative humidity during the midseason period were u2 = 1.1 m/s and RHmin = 30%. The latitude at Davis is 38.5o N and the midpoint of the midseason occurs on July 20. What is an adjusted Kcb mid for tomatoes that reflects the 50% ground cover condition? From Tables 12 and 17, Kc mid = 1.2 and Kcb mid = 1.15. Following adjustments for climate (Eq. 62 and Eq. 70) where u2 = 1.1 m/s, RHmin = 30% and mean crop height = 0.75 m, Kc = Kc,Table + [0.04(1.1-2)-0.004(30-45)](0.75/3)0.30 = Kc,Table + 0.02 yields, Kc mid = 1.22 and Kcb mid = 1.17. The ground cover fraction implied in the tabulated values for tomatoes grown under pristine conditions is about 85% (fc dense = 0.85). For a sparse tomato crop where fc = 0.50, From Eq. 96 Acm = 1 - (0.50/0.85)0.5 = 0.23 The Kcb mid adj and Kc mid adj for 50% ground cover is (from Eq. 94) Kcb mid adj = 1.17 - 0.23 = 0.94 Kc mid adj = 1.22 - 0.23 = 0.99 Compare the results with Example 42 where a more precise derivation of Kcb mid adj is made. As a first estimate, the crop coefficient is expected to be 20% lower than the value under pristine conditions."

This is especially true in semi-arid and arid climates.

Where LAI can be\nETc for natural, non-typical and non-pristine vegetation 186\nmeasured or approximated, a peak Kcb mid for natural, non-typical or non-pristine agricultural vegetation can be approximated similar to a procedure used by Ritchie as:\n( )( )]LAI7.0[exp1KKKK mincfullcbmincmidcb −−−+= (97) where Kcb mid estimated basal Kcb during the mid-season when plant density\nand/or leaf area are lower than for full cover conditions, Kcb full estimated basal Kcb during the mid-season (at peak plant size\nor height) for vegetation having full ground cover or LAI > 3 (Equations 99 and 100),\nKc min the minimum Kc for bare soil (Kc min ≈ 0.15 - 0.20), LAI actual leaf area index, defined as the area of leaves per area of\nunderlying ground surface averaged over a large area. Only one side of leaves is counted [m2 m-2].\nEquation 97 is recommended for annual types of vegetation that are either natural or are\nin a non-pristine state due to sparse density or effects of some type of environmental stress on growth.\nThe relationship expressed in Equation 97 produces results similar to those suggested by Ritchie (1974). For LAI > 3, Kcb mid ≈ Kcb full. The LAI used in Equation 97 should be the ‘green’ LAI representing only healthy leaves that are active in vapour transfer.\nBOX 17 Measuring and estimating LAI LAI can be measured directly by harvesting all green healthy leaves from vegetation over a measured or prescribed area, for example, 1 m2 or 10 m2, and then measuring and summing the areas of individual leaves using photometric methods or by measuring areas of several representative leaves, averaging, and then multiplying by the total number of leaves counted. In the absence of measurements for LAI, LAI can be estimated for sparse, annual vegetation as:\na\ndense dense Population\nPopulationLAILAI =\nwhere LAIdense LAI for the particular plant species under normal, ‘dense’ or pristine\ngrowing conditions. LAIdense can be obtained from various physiological sources and textbooks on crops and vegetation.\nPopulation number of plants per unit area of soil surface under the actual growing conditions [No. m-2]. Populationdense number of plants per unit area of soil surface under the ‘dense’ or pristine growing conditions [No. m-2]. a a = 0.5 when population is formed from vigorous growing plants; a\n= 1 when plants are less vigorous.\nThe 0.5 exponent in the equation simulates the tendency for vegetation to compensate for reduced stand density by increasing the size and total leaf areas for individual plants. Therefore, LAI does not fall in direct proportion to plant population. Under conditions where the plant size does not increase with reduced stand density, the ’a’ exponent in the equation should be set to 1 (a = 1). These latter conditions may occur where soil fertility is poor or where soil salinity, soil water stress, or waterlogging inhibit both growth and stand density, so that the growth of individual plants is retarded.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n187\nEstimation of Kcb mid from effective ground cover (fc eff) Where only estimates of the fraction of soil surface effectively covered by vegetation are available, the following approximation for Kcb mid adj can be used:\n( ) ( ) −+=\n+ h1 1\neffccmincfullcbmincmidcb f,f2,1minKKKK (98)\nwhere Kcb mid estimated basal Kcb during the mid-season when plant density and/or\nleaf area are lower than for full cover conditions, Kcb full estimated basal Kcb during the mid-season (at peak plant size or height)\nfor vegetation having full ground cover or LAI > 3 (see Equations 99 and 100),\nKc min the minimum Kc for bare soil (in the presence of vegetation) (Kc min ≈ 0.15 - 0.20), fc observed fraction of soil surface that is covered by vegetation as observed from nadir (overhead) [0.01 - 1], fc eff the effective fraction of soil surface covered or shaded by vegetation [0.01-1] (see Box 18), h the plant height [m].\nStomatal conductance and water transport within plants may limit ET under conditions of sparse, tall vegetation. Under these conditions, Kcb mid is limited by the “2fc” term in Equation 98. Equation 98 applies well to trees and shrubs.\nBOX 18 Measuring and estimating fc eff fc eff should normally represent the fraction of the soil surface that is shaded by vegetation. This value is generally larger than fc, the actual fraction of the soil surface that is covered by vegetation as observed from directly overhead. The amount of shading represents the amount of solar radiation intercepted by plants for potential conversion into evapotranspiration. The total fraction of shading is a function of the sun angle and the horizontal size and shape of individual plants (or rows) relative to their height. fc eff for ‘rectangular’ shaped canopies such as most agricultural plant rows can be approximated as:\n1 )tan(\nHWR1ff ceffc ≤\nη +=\nwhere fc observed fraction of soil surface that is covered by vegetation as observed from nadir\n(overhead) [0.01 - 1], HWR height to width ratio of individual plants or groups of plants when viewed from the east or from the west [ ], tan(η) tangent of the mean angle of the sun, η, above the horizon during the period of\nmaximum evapotranspiration (generally between 11.00 and 15.00 hours) [ ].

Therefore, in these situations, hcanopy < h where h is mean plant height.

This limit of 1.2 is adjusted for other climatic conditions in Equation 100. Equations 100 and 101 produce a general approximation for the increase in Kcb full with plant height and climate. The form of these equations adheres to trends represented in Equation 70.\nFor small, isolated stand sizes, Kcb full may need to be increased beyond the value given by Equation 99 or 100, as discussed in Chapter 10.\nETc for natural, non-typical and non-pristine vegetation 190"

    "text": "Equations 97 and 98 can be used to estimate or to reduce Kcb for non-pristine agricultural vegetation. The exponents in Equations 97 and 98 reflect the effects of microscale advection (transfer) of sensible heat from dry soil surfaces between plants toward plant leaves, thereby increasing ET per unit leaf area, and the effects of increased aerodynamic roughness as the value for LAI decreases. Equation 98 suggests that as h increases, total leaf area and effective roughness of vegetation increase, thereby increasing the crop coefficient. In addition, as h increases, more opportunity for microadvection of heat from soil to canopy occurs and turbulent exchange within the canopy increases for the same amount of ground coverage. All of these factors affect the relative magnitude of Kcb mid.\nEquations 97 and 98 should be used with caution as they provide only an estimate of the maximum Kcb expected during peak plant growth for vegetation with healthy transpiring leaves and a dry soil surface. Where stomatal control is greater than for typical agricultural vegetation, then the Kcb should be further reduced using the recommendations set out in the next section (Equation 102).\nEXAMPLE 41 Estimation of mid-season crop coefficient Estimate Kcb mid and Kc mid for rectangular shaped 2 m tall vegetation that is as tall as it is wide, where 30% of the ground is covered by vegetation (fc = 0.3) on 19 July (day 200 of the year) and at latitude 40°N. RHmin = 55% and u2 = 1.5 m/s during the mid-season period. On day J = 200 at latitude ϕ = 40 (π/180) = 0.70 radians (40°N), from Eq. 24, the solar declination δ = 0.36 radians. At solar noon (ω = 0): sin(η) = sin(ϕ)sin(δ) + cos(ϕ)cos(δ) = 0.94 The value for η by taking the arcsine of above value is 1.24 radians and tan(η) = 2.8. If fc = 0.3 and the HWR for the vegetation is 1, then fc eff from Box 18 is: 0.3(1+1/2.8) = 0.41. From Eq. 101 Kcb,h = 1.0 + 0.1(2) = 1.20 (≤ 1.20, so OK) From Eq. 100 Kcb full = 1.20 + (0.04(1.5-2) - 0.004(55-45)) (2/3)0.3 = 1.15 Therefore, Kcb mid estimated by Eq. 98 for Kc min = 0.15 is Kcb mid = Kc min + (Kcb full - Kc min) min[1, 2fc, (fc eff)(1/(1+h))] = 0.15+(1.15-0.15) min[1, 2(0.3), (0.4)(1/(1+2))] =0.75 This value does not need any further adjustment for climate. Kc mid (where Kc mid includes average wetting effects) can be derived from Kcb mid using the guidelines presented in the calculation procedures at the beginning of this chapter Kc mid = Kcb mid + (0.05 ... 0.10) = 0.80 .. 0.85 depending on the frequency of soil wetting. The estimated crop coefficients for the mid-season stage are Kcb mid = 0.75 and Kc mid = 0.80 to 0.85.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n191\nEXAMPLE 42 Estimation of mid-season crop coefficient for reduced ground cover A more precise estimate of Kcb mid for the tomato crop of Example 40 that only developed 50% ground cover at Davis, California, the United States can be calculated if one knows that the tomato crop was planted in 1.52 m rows running east-west, that the crop reached a plant height of 0.75 m and that the height to width ratio of the tomato crop can be estimated as about 1.0 for the east-west rows. The latitude is 38.5°N and the midpoint of the mid-season occurs on July 20. What is the adjusted Kcb mid for tomatoes that reflects the 50% ground cover condition?\nOn day J = 201 (20 July) at latitude ϕ = 38.5 (π/180) = 0.67 radians (38.5°N), from Eq. 24 the solar declination δ = 0.36 radians. At solar noon (ω = 0): sin(η) = sin(ϕ)sin(δ) + cos(ϕ)cos(δ) = 0.95 The value for η by taking the arcsine of the above value is 1.26 radians. Therefore, for the observed HWR = 1 and fc = 0.5, the effective soil cover for the east-west rows can be calculated as (Box 18): fc eff = 0.5 [1 + 1/tan(1.26)] = 0.66 The Kcb mid in Table 17 representing a full cover tomato crop is 1.15 and the average h for fully developed tomatoes (this variety) is about 0.75 also. Following adjustment for climate (using Eq. 99) Kcb full = 1.15 + [0.04(1.1-2) - 0.004(30-45)] (0.75/3)0.30 = 1.17 From Eq. 98 and using Kc min = 0.15, the adjusted Kcb mid for 50% ground cover would be: Kcb mid adj = 0.15 + (1.17 - 0.15) min(1, 2(0.5), 0.661/(1+0.76)) = 0.95 The results Kcb mid adj = 0.95 for 50% ground cover are similar to the first estimate calculated in Example 40 and compare with the measured Kcb mid ∼ 0.90 to1.00 as determined by precision lysimeter by Pruitt et al. (1984)."

    "text": "The value for Kcb full in Equations 97 and 98 may need to be reduced for vegetation that has a high degree of stomatal control. For vegetation such as some types of desert vegetation or trees with leaf resistance significantly greater than that of most agricultural crops where rl is commonly about 100 s m-1, the Kcb mid estimated using Equations 97 and 98 can be modified by multiplying by a resistance correction factor, Fr. The resistance correction factor is developed based on the FAO Penman-Monteith equation:\n+γ+∆\n+γ+∆ ≈\n100 r u34.01\n)u34.01( F\nl 2\n2 r (102)\nwhere rl mean leaf resistance for the vegetation in question [s m-1].\nThe mean leaf resistance rl is 100 s m-1 for the grass ETo reference and for many agricultural crops. Values for rl for many agricultural and non-agricultural plants can be found in Körner et al. (1978) and Allen et al. (1996). Equation 102 reflects the fixed aerodynamic roughness of grass rather than the roughness of the specific vegetation, since the adjusted Kc is multiplied by the grass ETo and the Kc already reflects the effects of the aerodynamic roughness for the specific vegetation.\nETc for natural, non-typical and non-pristine vegetation 192\nEXAMPLE 43 Estimation of Kcb mid from ground cover with reduction for stomatal control A grove of olive trees has a tree spacing of 10 m. The horizontal diameter of the trees as viewed from overhead is 5 m. The tree height is 5 m. The lower 1.5 m of the trees have no foliage. The ground cover between the trees is bare. The mean u2 during the mid-season growth stage is 2 m/s and the mean RHmin = 25%. The midpoint of the mid-season growth stage is on 29 June (i.e., day 180 of the year). The latitude of the location is 30°N. Estimate Kcb mid using Eq. 98 for the 10x10 m and for a 5x10 m spacing. On day J = 180 (29 June) at latitude ϕ = 30 (π/180) = 0.52 radians (30°N) and from Eq. 24 the solar declination δ = 0.405 radians. At solar noon (ω = 0): sin(η) = sin(ϕ)sin(δ) + cos(ϕ)cos(δ) = 0.99 As olive trees have somewhat round shapes, the effective fraction of ground cover (Box 18) can be estimated as fc eff = fc/(sin(η)). fc = area of canopy/area tree spacing = (π(5)2/4)/(10)(10) = 0.196 fc eff = 0.196/0.99 = 0.20 From Eq. 101: Kcb,h = 1.0 +0.1(5) > 1.2 or Kcb,h = 1.2 From Eq. 100: Kcb full = 1.2 + [0-0.004(25-45)] (5/3)0.3 = 1.29 From Eq. 98 and using Kc min = 0.15: Kcb mid = 0.15 + (1.29 - 0.15) min(1, 2(0.196), (0.20)1/(1+5)) = 0.60 Körner et al. (1979) indicate that olives (Olea europaea) have rl of about 420 s/m. Therefore, assuming that average Tmean = 25°C and that the elevation of the grove is 0 m (sea level), so that ∆ = 0.189 kPa (Eq. 13) and γ = 0.0676 kPa (Eq. 8), Fr is estimated from Eq. 102 as:\n67.0\n100 420)2(34.010676.0189.0\n))2(34.01(0676.0189.0Fr =\n++\n++ ≈\nThe Kcb mid adjusted for increased stomatal control using Fr is then Kcb mid adj = Fr Kcb mid = 0.67 (0.60) = 0.40 The value Kcb mid adj = 0.40 estimated for fc = 0.20 is less than the value for Kcb mid in Table 17 for olives for fc = 0.40 to 0.67, due to the differences in fc. The value from Table 17 is 0.70, which after adjustment for climate using Eq. 70 equals 0.79. If the olives had been planted on a 5x10 m spacing, as is common in California, the United States, and which is reflected in the Kcb values for olives in Table 17, then fc = 0.39, fc eff = 0.40, and Kcb mid from Eq. 98 is Kcb mid = 1.04, so that the estimated Kcb mid adjusted for stomatal control using Fr = 0.67 is Kcb mid adj = 0.67(1.04) = 0.70. This value compares with the value of 0.79 obtained from Table 17 for mature trees, after adjustment for climate. The basal crop coefficient, Kcb mid, taking the low density, climatic condition and stomatal control into account is 0.40. It increases to 0.70 for the 5x10 m spacing.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n193\nThe equation would underestimate Fr (overestimate the reduction in Kcb) if used with the actual roughness of the vegetation when rl > 100 s m-1 because of the lack in Equation 102 of feedback effects that reduced ETc has on temperature and vapour pressure deficit profiles over the crop. These parameters generally increase with decreasing ETc and therefore dampen the reduction in ETc."

    "heading": "LATE SEASON STAGE",
    "text": "During the late season stage, the Kcb begins to decrease until it reaches Kcb end at the end of the growing period. Values for Kcb end can be scaled from Kcb mid in proportion to the health and leaf condition of the vegetation at termination of the growing season and according to the length of the late season period (i.e., whether leaves senesce slowly or are killed by frost). Values for Kc end can be similarly scaled from Kc mid; however, the reduction in Kc end will be affected by the frequency of wetting by irrigation or precipitation and Kc end may be proportionally less.\nIf estimated from Equations 97 and 98, Kcb end should be reduced if it is to represent Kc values for plants with stomatal control that is greater than that for agricultural vegetation (where rl ≈ 100 s m-1) or to reflect effects of ageing and senescence on stomatal control. In these situations, the estimated Kcb end values should be multiplied by the Fr from Equation 102. Alternatively, they can be reduced by about 10% for each doubling of rl above 100 s m-1 when mean daily air temperature (Tmean) is about 30o C and by about 20% for each doubling of rl above 100 s m-1 when Tmean is about 15o C.\nAlternatively, the value for Kcb end can be reduced relative to the calculated value for Kcb mid in proportion to the fraction of green healthy leaves remaining at the end of the late season stage relative to that during the mid-season. This can often be based on a visual survey of the field and may therefore be a subjective observation.\nThe fc parameter and h are probably the simplest indices to estimate in the field. Again, Equations 97 and 98 should be used only as general or preliminary estimates of Kcb end. ESTIMATING ETc adj USING CROP YIELDS A simple, linear crop-water production function was introduced in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 33 to predict the reduction in crop yield when crop stress is caused by a shortage of soil water. This function was presented earlier as Equation 90:\n−= −\nc\nadjc y\nm\na ET\nET 1K Y Y 1 (90)\nwhere Ya = actual yield of the crop [kg ha-1] Ym = maximum (expected) yield in absence of environmental or water\nstresses Ky = yield response factor [ ] ETc = potential (expected) crop evapotranspiration in the absence of environmental or water stresses (Kc ETo) ETc adj = actual (adjusted) crop evapotranspiration as a result of environmental\nor water stresses\nETc for natural, non-typical and non-pristine vegetation 194\nValues for Ky have been reported in Paper No. 33 for a wide range of crops for predicting the effect of water stress and associated reduction in ETc adj on crop yield. Factors are presented there for predicting yield reductions for when stress occurs in only one crop growth stage, or when stress is distributed throughout the growing period. Seasonal yield response functions are summarized in Table 24.\nMany environmental stresses such as water shortage, salinity, low fertility and disease impact yield by reducing the amount of ETc adj relative to the potential amount ETc. The same can be true for when yields are reduced due to the use of low densities for plant populations. Therefore, for very general estimates of ETc adj, one can invert Equation 90 and solve for the stress factor, Ks:\n−−=\nm\na\ny s Y\nY 1 K 11K (103)\nwhere Ks is multiplied by Kcb or by Kc in equations 80 or 81 to predict the ETc adj in the presense of the water or other environmental stresses or for low plant populations or virility. The ETc adj predicted using Ks from equation 103 provides only a very general and approximate estimate of monthly or even seasonal evapotranspiration. Equation 103 works best for forage or other indiscriminate crops where the value for Ky is relatively constant during the season.\nEquation 103 is generally only valid for use in predicting actual crop evapotranspiration for use in regional water balance studies, for studies of ground-water depletion and recharge, or for estimating historical water use. The procedure is not valid for predicting ETc for daily or weekly time periods due to the very general nature of the Ky coefficient and the seasonal time scale of the crop yield. The procedures presented previously for adjusting ETc using a daily soil water balance, salinity functions, or reductions in Kc based on leaf area or fraction of ground cover are recommended over the use of equation 103.\nEXAMPLE 44 Approximate estimation of Ks from crop yield data An irrigation scheme (project) cultivates dry, edible beans. There is known to be a shortage of irrigation water and a corresponding reduction in crop yield. The reported yield for the scheme averages 1100 kg/ha. The potential yield for the region and variety of beans, in the absence of water or environmental stresses and with good soil fertility is 1800 kg/ha. From FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 33 or Table 24, the Ky for dry beans, assuming that stresses are distributed uniformly through the growing season, is 1.15. Therefore, from Equation 103, the estimated Ks to apply with Equation 80 for the growing season is:\n66.0 1800 11001 15.1 11Ks = −−=\nTherefore, the ETc adj for the season is predicted to be only 0.66 of maximum ETc under pristine growing conditions.\nThe estimated seasonal ETc adj is predicted to be ETc adj = 0.66 ETc where ETc is predicted as ETc = Kc ETo.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n195\nChapter 10\nETc under various management practices\nThis chapter discusses various types of factors that may cause the values for Kc and ETc to deviate from the standard values described in the Chapters 6 and 7. These factors refer to the effects of surface mulches, intercropping, small areas of vegetation and specific cultivation practices.\nThis chapter is intended to serve as a resource for situations where cultivation practices are known to deviate from those assumed in Tables 12 and 17, but where estimates of Kc and ETc are still necessary. This chapter is by no means exhaustive. The intent is to demonstrate some of the procedures that can be used to make adjustments to Kc to account for deviations from standard conditions."

Holes are cut into the plastic film at plant spacings to allow the plant vegetation to emerge. Plastic mulches can be transparent, white or black. Colour influences albedo mainly during the early stages of the crop. However, as the intention is to use a simple procedure for adjusting Kc for mulched crops, no distinction is made between the different types of plastic mulches.\nPlastic mulches substantially reduce the evaporation of water from the soil surface, especially under trickle irrigation systems. Associated with the reduction in evaporation is a general increase in transpiration from vegetation caused by the transfer of both sensible and radiative heat from the surface of the plastic cover to adjacent vegetation. Even though the transpiration rates under mulch may increase by an average of 10-30% over the season as compared to using no mulch, the Kc values decrease by an average of 10-30% due to the 50- 80% reduction in soil evaporation. A summary of observed reductions in Kc, in evaporation, and increases in transpiration over growing seasons is given in Table 25 for five horticultural crops.

The effect on Kcb could be greater in some situations and with some types of low density crops. Local calibration of Kcb (and Kc) for use with mulch culture is encouraged.\nWhen calculating the soil evaporation coefficient Ke with plastic mulch, the fw should represent the relative equivalent fraction of the ground surface that can contribute to evaporation through the vent holes in the plastic cover and to the fraction of surface that is wetted, but is not covered by the mulch.

The mulch is clear plastic covering the entire field surface, with small openings at each plant. Adjust both the mean and basal Kc values for this crop to reflect the presence of the mulch. From Table 12, Kc ini, Kc mid and Kc end for fresh market cucumbers have values equal to 0.4, 1.0 and 0.75. As the plastic mulch is continuous with only small vents at each plant, the Kc ini is assumed to be only 0.10 (this value should be adjusted upward if precipitation occurs). The Kc mid and Kc end values are estimated as: Kc mid = 0.85 (1.0) = 0.85 Kc end = 0.85 (0.75) = 0.64 where the 0.85 multipliers are derived from Table 25 and reflect an assumed 15% reduction in ETc due to the mulch, assuming an approximately weekly irrigation frequency. From Table 17, the values for Kcb ini, Kcb mid, and Kcb end are 0.15, 0.95 and 0.7 for this same cucumber crop. The Kcb ini is assumed to be similar to the Kc ini for mulched cover and is therefore set equal to 0.10. The Kcb mid and Kcb end values are estimated to be reduced by 10% so that: Kcb mid = 0.9 (0.95) = 0.86 Kcb end = 0.9 (0.7) = 0.63 These basal values are similar to the adjusted values for Kc. This is expected as evaporation from the mulch covered surface can be ignored. Additional adjustment to these Kc values to account for climate is necessary using Eq. 62 and 70. The values for mean Kc and Kcb are similar with values of 0.10 for the initial stage, 0.85 for the midseason stage and 0.64 at the end of the late season stage."

Interplanted among the rows of palms are small orange trees (50% canopy) on a 6 m spacing. The palm and citrus trees are 3 m from one another in the rows. Height of the palms is 10 m and height of the citrus is 3 m. The canopy foliage of the palms is well above that of the citrus so that the canopies cannot be considered contiguous. Mean average RHmin during the mid-season is 20% and u2 = 2 m/s. The Kc mid from Table 12 for dates is 0.95 and when adjusted for humidity and wind using Eq. 62 is Kc mid = 1.09. The Kc mid from Table 12 for citrus having 50% canopy with no ground cover is 0.60 and when adjusted for humidity and wind using Eq. 62 is Kc mid = 0.70. The interplanting of citrus among the date palms has increased the total leaf area of the orchard so that ETc for the combined planting (palms and citrus together) will be greater than for either planting alone. The estimated combined Kc mid will be estimated as a function of the increase in total LAI. First the LAI values of the individual plantings are estimated by inverting Eq. 97 to solve for LAI:\n−\n− −−=\nmincfullcb\nminccb KK\nKK 1ln4.1LAI\nwhere Kc min is the minimum basal Kc for bare soil (≈ 0.15 to 0.20) and Kcb full is the maximum midseason Kc expected for the crop if there were complete ground cover, calculated using Eq. 99. Based on Eq. 99, with h = 10 m for the date palms and h = 3 m for the citrus, the Kcb full values for the two crops, assuming complete ground cover for each, are Kcb full = 1.34 for palms and Kcb full = 1.30 for citrus (using RHmin = 20% and u2 = 2 m/s). These estimates ignore effects of any unique stomatal control. Therefore, using the above equation, the effective LAI values of the date palms and citrus are estimated to be approximately:\nLAIpalms = - 1.4 ln[1-(1.09-0.15)/(1.34-0.15)] = 2.2 LAIcitrus = - 1.4 ln[1-(0.70-0.15)/(1.30-0.15)] = 0.9 Therefore, the effective LAI for the date palm-citrus combination is estimated to be approximately LAIcombined = LAIpalms + LAIcitrus = 2.2 + 0.9 = 3.1. The increase in Kc mid for the date palm orchard resulting from the increase in LAI from the interplanting of citrus is estimated using a ratio of the LAI-based function introduced in Eq. 97. This results in the relationship:\n( ) ( ) −− −− = cropsingle combined cropsingle,midcmid c LAI0.7exp1 LAI0.7exp1 KK\nwhere LAIcombined is the LAI for the two intercropped plantings combined and LAIsingle crop is the LAI for the taller, single crop. Kc mid single crop is the mid-season Kc for the taller, single crop (in this case the date palms). In this application, the above equation is solved as:\n( ) ( ) 23.1)2.2(0.7exp1 )1.3(0.7exp109.1K mid c = −− −−=\nTherefore, the Kc mid estimated for the complex of date palms and citrus together is 1.23. This value is compared with the maximum expected Kc based on energy limitations, represented by Kc max of Eq. 72 which in this case for h=10 m is Kc max = 1.34. Because Kc mid < Kc max (i.e., 1.23 < 1.34), the Kc mid = 1.23 is accepted as the approximate estimate of the Kc mid for the intercropped field.\nETc under various management practices 202"

    "heading": "Clothesline and oasis effects",
    "text": "Under the clothesline effect, where vegetation height is greater than that of the surroundings (different roughness conditions), or under the oasis effect, where vegetation has higher soil water availability than the surroundings (different moisture conditions), the peak Kc values may exceed the 1.20-1.40 limit. The user should exercise caution when extrapolating ET measurements taken from these sorts of vegetation stands or plots to larger stands or regions as an overestimation of regional ET may occur.\nSmall expanses of tall vegetation that are surrounded by shorter cover can exhibit a clothesline effect. This occurs where turbulent transport of sensible heat into the canopy and transport of vapour away from the canopy is increased by the ‘broadsiding’ of wind horizontally into the taller vegetation. In addition, the internal boundary layer above the vegetation may not be in equilibrium with the new surface. Therefore, ET from the isolated expanses, on a per unit area basis, may be significantly greater than the corresponding ETo computed for the grass reference. Examples of the clothesline or oasis effects would be ET from a single row of trees surrounded by short vegetation or surrounded by a dry non-cropped field, or ET from a narrow strip of cattails (a hydrophytic vegetation) along a stream channel. Kc values up to and exceeding two have been recorded for such situations.\nWhere ET estimates are needed for such small, isolated expanses of vegetation surrounded by shorter cover (clothesline effect) or dry land (oasis effect), then the Kc may exceed the grass reference by 100% or more. Estimates of Kc for the expanses of vegetation should contain u2, RHmin and h parameters to adjust Kc values, and parameters expressing the aridity of the surrounding area, the general width of the vegetation stand and the ability of the wind to penetrate into the vegetation. The equation should also consider the LAI of the vegetation to account for the ability of the vegetation to conduct and transpire the amount of water demanded by the clothesline/climatic condition. An upper limit of 2.5 is usually placed on Kc to represent an upper limit on the stomatal capacity of the vegetation to supply water vapour to the air stream under the clothesline or oasis conditions. For vegetation with a great leaf resistance, such as for some types of desert vegetation or trees, the upper limit should be multiplied by a resistance correction factor, Fr, calculated in Chapter 9 using Equation 102.\nFigure 46 presents example curves of Kc for small areas of vegetation versus vegetation stand width, for conditions where u2 = 2 m/s, RHmin = 30%, vegetation height = 2 m, and LAI = 3. The upper curve represents conditions where the specific vegetation is surrounded by dead vegetation, dry bare soil, or even gravel or asphalt. In this situation, large amounts of sensible heat are generated from the surrounding area due to the lack of ET. Some of this sensible heat is advected into the vegetation downwind. The lower curve represents conditions where the vegetation is surrounded by well-watered grass. In this situation, there is much less sensible heat available from the surrounding area to increase ET (and Kc) of vegetation downwind. The influence of the aridity of the surroundings on the Kc for a small expanse is apparent. The two curves shown will change with changes in u2, RHmin, h, and LAI. The user is cautioned that Figure 46 provides only general estimates of Kc under clothesline and oasis conditions. These estimates should be verified where possible using valid local measurements.\nET estimates from large expanses of vegetation or from small expanses of vegetation that are surrounded by mixtures of other vegetation having similar roughness and moisture conditions should almost always be less than or equal to 1.4 ETo, even under arid conditions.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n203\nFor tall wind breaks, such as single rows of trees, an approximate estimate for Kc is:\n+= 5.2,\nWidth\ncanopyhrF 2.1mincK (105)\nwhere Fr stomatal resistance correction factor (Equation 102) hcanopy mean vertical height of canopy area [m] Width width (horizontal thickness) of the windbreak [m]\nThe Kc = 2.5 limit imposed in Equation 105 represents an approximate upper limit on ETc of trees per unit ground area. However, this value has large uncertainty. Because availability of soil water may limit evapotranspiration from wind breaks, a soil water balance and calculation of the Ks stress factor should be conducted. MANAGEMENT INDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS\nMany agricultural crops are intentionally water stressed during specific crop growth periods to encourage particular crop characteristics. The water stress is initiated by withholding or by reducing irrigations. In situations where this type of cultural management is practised, the Kc should be reduced to account for the reduction in evapotranspiration.\nEnvironmental stress from soil water shortage, low soil fertility, or soil salinity can cause some types of plants to accelerate their reproductive cycle. In these situations, the length of the growing season may be shortened, particularly the mid-season period. Stress during the\nFIGURE 46 Kc curves for small areas of vegetation under the oasis effect as a function of the width of the expanse of vegetation for conditions where RHmin = 30%, u2 = 2 m/s, vegetation height (h) = 2 m and LAI = 3\nK c dry surroundings\nsurrounded by well-watered grass\nupper limit on K c\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nwidth of vegetation stand (m)\nETc under various management practices 204\ndevelopment period may increase the length of that period.

In areas subject to freezing winters, the reduction in Kc for deep rooted crops such as alfalfa depends upon the amount of water made available from precipitation during the dormant (winter) season and upon the amount of rainfall and limited irrigation during the growing season. Therefore, the effects of the intentional stress on the values for Kc should be modelled using the basal crop procedure presented in Chapter 7 and the Ks coefficient and water balance procedure presented in Chapter 8."

For cotton, the attainment of full cover and the beginning of the mid-season generally occurs when the LAI reaches approximately three. When soil water stress and growth retardation is practised, full cover may occur after the beginning of flowering. The effect of stress during the development period on ETc can be incorporated into the Kc curve by extending the length of the development period into the midseason period.

The reduction in Kc could be significant where windbreaks are tall and frequent. However, the Kc for the entire field area, including the windbreaks, may be increased by the presence of the trees, relative to the values for Kc for coffee shown in Table 12, due to increased total leaf area of the coffee-tree combination and the increased aerodynamic roughness."

Therefore, in the dual Kc approach, the value for fc should be set equal to zero to reflect the lack of green cover and fw should be set equal to 1.0 to reflect the wetting of both soil and mulch cover by precipitation.\nThe dead mulch or vegetation will dry more quickly than would the underlying soil if it were exposed. In addition, the soil will be protected somewhat from evaporation by the dead mulch or vegetation cover. Therefore, total evaporation losses will be less than the TEW predicted from Equation 73. This can be accounted for by reducing the value for TEW by 5% for each 10% of soil surface that is effectively covered by an organic mulch. The value for REW should be limited to less than or equal to that for TEW. Surface covered with live vegetation During frost-free periods following harvest, weeds may begin to germinate and grow. This vegetation is supplied with water from storage in the soil profile and from any rainfall. In addition, crop seed lost during harvest may germinate following rainfall events and add to the ground cover. The amount of ground surface covered by vegetation will depend on the severity of weed infestation; the density of the volunteer crop; the frequency and extent of soil tillage; the availability of soil water or rain, and any damage by frost.\nThe value for Kcb during the non-growing period can be predicted over time according to the amount of vegetation covering the surface.

Otherwise, the law of conservation of mass will be violated. Under all conditions, the integration of Kc ETo over the course of the non-growing period cannot exceed the sum of the precipitation occurring during the period plus any residual soil water in the root zone following harvest that can be depleted by the subsequent vegetation. The root zone in this case is the root zone for the weed or volunteer crops.

Then, a full daily soil water\nCrop evapotranspiration\n209\nbalance of the topsoil together with a full daily soil water balance of the root zone can be employed as described in Chapter 7. The soil water balances will automatically adhere to the law of conservation of mass, so that total ETc from the weed or volunteer vegetation will not be overestimated. Again, because the topsoil layer may dry to below wilting point under conditions of sparse rainfall, the values for Kcb and Kc min used in Equations 71 and 76 should be set equal to zero. In this manner, the daily soil water balance with dual Kc calculations can progress throughout the non-growing period with good results. Frozen or snow covered surfaces Where the ground surface is snow covered or frozen, any vegetation will be largely nonresponsive and non-contributing to ETc, and the amount of ETc will be closely related to the availability of free water at the surface and to the albedo of the surface.\nThe albedo of snow covered surfaces can range from 0.40 for old, dirty snow cover to 0.90 for fresh, dry snow. Therefore, the ETc for snow cover will be less than ETo for grass, as 25-85% less shortwave energy is available. In addition, some energy must be used to melt the snow before evaporation.\nThe use of ETo under such conditions is of limited value, as the assumption of conditions sustaining a green grass cover is violated. It is even possible to obtain negative values for ETo on some winter days where the longwave radiation from the surface is large and the vapour pressure deficit is small. It is under these conditions that net condensation of water from the atmosphere is possible. This would be similar to negative evaporation.\nGiven the limited value of ETo (or even ETp) under snow covered or frozen conditions, a single, average value may be best used to predict ETc. Wright (1993) found that ETc averaged 1 mm/day over winter periods at Kimberly, Idaho, the United States, that were six months long (1 October to 30 March). The latitude of Kimberly is 42°N and the elevation is about 1 200 m. Over the six-year study period, the ground was 50% covered by snow for 25% of the time from 1 October to 30 March. The ground, when exposed, was frozen about 50% of the time. The Kc averaged 0.25 during periods when the soil was not frozen but where frosts were occurring (October and early November). When the ground had 50% snow cover or greater, the ETc averaged only 0.4 mm/day. Wright found that over the six-month non-growing period, total cumulative ETc exceeded precipitation by about 50 mm.\nFigure 47 shows the mean measurements of ETc during the 1985-1991 study period. The measurements have high correspondence to the total shortwave radiation energy available on a clear day, Rso, estimated as 0.75 Ra. There is some lag between ETc and Rso and Rs caused by cooler temperatures in January – March as compared to the October – December period. The ETc/Rso ratio averaged only 0.17 over the six-month period, and averaged 0.11 from 1 Dec. – 10 Mar. The ETc/Rs ratio averaged 0.23 over the six-month period, and averaged 0.15 from 1 Dec. – 10 Mar.\nA similar study conducted in Logan, Utah, the United States (latitude 41.6°N, elevation 1 350 m) over an eight-year period showed that ETc varied widely with soil surface wetness and air temperature during the winter months. The ‘average’ Kc from November to March was 0.5 for days having no snow cover. For days with snow cover, ‘ETc’ ranged from 0 to 1.5 mm/day. Similarly, Kc is about 0.4 for winter wheat during frozen periods in the region of northern China (latitude near 39°N.\nETc during non-growing periods 210"

They rely upon the statistical comparison of two data sets, one considered homogeneous and constituted by the observations Xi, the other being the one under analysis and consitutued by the observations Yi of the same weather variable (Tmax, Tmin, u2, RHmax,..., etc). Both sets Xi and Yi should be collected at two stations that are in the same climatic region, i. e., Xi and Yi should present the same trends in time despite the space variability when short time scales (daily, weekly or decadaily) are utilized.\nThe reference observations Xi are selected from a weather station for which the data set can be considered to be homogeneous.(3) The Xi data set should have the same time length of observations as the set of observations Yi."

The magnitudes of α and β depend on the size of the data set, on the standard deviation of the sample being tested and on the probability p used to test the hypothesis(4).\nThe procedure for analysing the homogeneity of a weather data set Yi collected in a given weather station environment can be summarized as follows:\n1.

As with the method of cumulative residuals discussed in the last section, the double-mass technique requires data sets from two weather stations, where Xi (i = 1, 2,...,n) is a chronologic data set for a given weather variable observed for a certain time length at a “reference” station, and which is considered to be homogeneous, and where Yi is a data set of the same variable, with the same time length, observed at another station and for which homogeneity needs to be analysed.\nIn the double-mass technique, starting with the first observed pair of values X1 and Y1, cumulative data sets are created by progressively summing values of Xi and Yi to verify whether the long term trends in variation of Xi and Yi are the same. Thus the following cumulative variables are obtained\nxi = X + Xi j j = 1\ni - 1 (4-23)\nand\nAnnex 4: Statistical analysis of weather data sets 238\nyi = Y + Yi j j = 1\ni - 1 (4-24)\nwith i = 1,..., n and j = 1,..., i - 1.\nThese variables xi and yi are still considered to be random variables and are characterized by the mean and the standard deviation (equations 4-1 to 4-4). The yi and xi variables can be related through linear regression (equations 4-5 to 4-8). However, the double mass technique is typically applied as a graphical procedure.\nThe graphical application of the double-mass analysis is done by plotting all coordinate points xi and yi. The plot is then visually analysed to determine whether successive points of xi and yi follow an unique straight line, indicating the homogeneity of the data set Yi relative to data set Xi. If there appears to be a break (or more than one break) in the the plot of yi to xi, then there is a visual indication that the data series Yi (or perhaps Xi) is not homogeneous (Figure 4.5). The break at coordinates xk and yk can be used to separate two subsets (i = 1, 2, ..., k) and (k + 1, k + 2,..., n). One of the subsets is to be corrected. The appropriate one to correct needs to be identified by consulting the records of the weather station, when available.\nCrop evapotranspiration\n239\nOften, visual interpretation of the double-mass balance is difficult.

Assessments of weather data integrity and quality need to be conducted before data are utilized in ETo equations. When necessary and when possible, corrections to the data should be made to account for poor sensor calibration. Some of these corrections are described in section 1 of Annex 4.\nA good cautionary statement in data analysis and application is that “no data are better than bad data.” This statement applies primarily to measurements of evapotranspiration that are used to develop or to calibrate reference ET equations or to determine crop coefficients. However, it also applies to weather data. When one has no data, one can look to regional weather or ET data summaries for information that might be useful to represent conditions within the local area. In the case of ET data, one might go to a publication such as this one to make reasonably accurate estimates of ETo and ETc. However, in the case of “bad” data, meaning biased, or faulty, or nonrepresentative data collected locally, one is “stuck” with weather data and associated predictions of ETo and ETc, or with local measurements of ETc that can be biased, faulty, or nonrepresentative. The result is application of evapotranspiration data or evapotranspiration calculations to irrigation water management, to water resources operations, or to irrigation and water resources systems design that can actually cause more economic and hydrologic problems than if only reasonable estimates or even “textbook” values for ETc had been used instead. Humanity can be worse off because of faulty data as compared to no data.\nSome years ago, when computer modeling was in its infancy, a common cautionary advice was to “do not trust any model until it has been validated using independent data.” Today, with some of the more common mathematical models becoming proven and trustworthy, the corollary of this expression is commonly advocated, where “one should not trust any data until they are validated using a model!” Certainly, some place in between these two cautionary advocations is appropriate. Often a valid model can be valuable for evaluating data to identify errors, outliers and biases. And of course, valid data are required for selecting or calibrating a particular model.\nThis Annex presents guidelines to be used to calculate both extreme ranges for weather data measurements and also means to assess integrity of data that fall between the extremes. A review on instrumentation for agricultural weather stations is given first.\nAnnex 5: Measuring and assessing integrity of weather data 246"

    "text": "Solar radiation is commonly measured with pyranometers. Pyranometers measure the shortwave incoming radiation in a solid angle in the shape of a hemisphere oriented upwards. Currently, in the most common “glassed dome” pyranometers, a thermopile is used within the instrument as the sensor, where thermal gradients are measured across hot and cold areas (black and white). The radiation intensity is proportional to the temperature differences between the two sensing areas. Accuracy depends upon the sensitivity of the material used in the sensors, the response time and the distortion characteristics of the material constituting the dome covering the sensors. A second type of pyranometer that is less expensive and that is gaining acceptance is the silicon diode instrument where electric current is generated by a photo sensitive diode in proportion to solar intensity. Ordinarily, silicon diode pyranometers are not fully sensitive to the full spectrum of visible light, so that the calibration of the instrument is only valid for upward solar measurements.\nWhen a pyranometer is oriented downwards it measures the reflected shortwave radiation, and is thus called an albedometer. When two pyranometers are associated, one oriented upwards and the other downwards, the net short wave radiation is measured. The instrument is then called a net pyranometer. A point of caution is that any instrument used as an albedometer or net pyranameter must have full sensitivity to all spectra of visible light. This is important since the composition of reflected light from vegetation is highly biased toward green. Therefore, most albedometers must be of the glass domed thermopile type and not the photo diode type.\nNet radiation is measured by pyradiometers (or net radiometers), which sense both short and long wave radiation. They have two bodies, one oriented upwards and the other downwards, both covering a solid angle in the shape of a hemisphere. The sensors are made from several thermocouples sensing heat generated by radiation from all wavelengths, and are protected by domes made in general of polyethylene treated in a specific manner. The black bodies can loose their sensing capabilities with time, so that these instruments require regular and frequent calibrations. Other net radiometers are comprised of ventilated differential thermopiles, but they are very seldom utilized. All radiometers refered to above transform the radiation energy into thermal energy, a portion of which is transformed into an electric voltage gradient that provides appropriate conditions for continuous recording using dataloggers.\nSunshine duration is most commonly recorded with the Campbell-Stokes heliograph. A glass globe focuses the radiation beam to a special recording paper and a trace is burned on the paper as the sun is moving. No records occur when no bright sunshine is sensed. Measurements are reliable when the recording paper is placed in the right position according to the relative position of the sun. Care is required to avoid accumulation of rain water on the paper. The heliograph has to be oriented South in the northern hemisphere and North in the\n1 Details on weather station instrumentation can be found in FAO 27 (Doorenbos, 1976), in the WMO\nGuide to Agrometeorological Practices (WMO, 1981, 1983), or in meteorology handbooks (Seemann et al., 1979; Rosenberg et al., 1983; Kessler et al., 1990).\nCrop evapotranspiration\n247\nsouthern hemisphere. In China, another type of heliograph is used. The solar beam penetrates through an orifice and traces a recording paper treated with a sensible chemical substance. Electronic records of sunshine duration are obtained through the photo-electric or the rotating optical fibre sunshine recorders."

Most common are the three-cup anemometers. Also common are propeller anemometers. Measurements by both types are reliable provided that maintenance ensures appropriate functioning of the mechanical parts. Older designs of anemometers utilize mechanical counters as the output device. Modern anemometers may be equipped with generators giving a voltage signal that is proportional to the windspeed. Other anemometers may be equipped with small magnetic reed switches or with opto-electronic couplers that generate electric impulses in proportion to the windspeed. The electronic devices are utilized in automatic weather stations. Accuracy of windspeed measurements depends on the upwind fetch as much as on instrumentation. A large upwind fetch that is free of buildings and trees is definitely required for representative measurements."

Bimetallic thermographs are the most common mechanical temperature recorders. They are easy to read and maintain. However, mechanical thermographs do require verification and adjustment of the position of the pen recorder. These instruments are installed in shelters that are naturally ventilated.\nModern temperature sensors have been developed, namely the thermistor and the thermocouple. These provide very accurate analogue measurements and are normally utilized in automatic weather stations. Thermistors provide independent measurements of air or soil temperature, whereas thermocouples require an additional base temperature reading, normally provided by a thermistor. To maintain the accuracy and representativeness of these instruments, they are installed in special radiation shields (shelters) having natural ventilation. Occasionally the shields or shelters are artificially aspirated to reduce biases caused by heat loading from the sun."

    "text": "Dew point temperature is often measured with a mirrorlike metallic surface that is artificially cooled. When dew forms on the surface, its temperature is sensed as Tdew. Other dew sensor systems use chemical or electric properties of certain materials that are altered when absorbing water vapour. Instruments for measuring dew point temperature require careful operation and maintenance and are seldom available in weather stations. The accuracy of estimation of the actual vapour pressure from Tdew is generally very high.\nRelative humidity is measured using hygrometers. Most frequently used in mechanically-based field stations are the hair hygrometers, normally operated as mechanical hygrographs. Measurements loose accuracy with dust and ageing of the hairs. Modern hygrometers use a film from a dielectric polymer that changes its dielectric constant with\nAnnex 5: Measuring and assessing integrity of weather data 248\nchanges in surface moisture, thus inducing a variation of the capacity of a condensator using that dielectric. These instruments are normally called dielectric polymer capacitive hygrometers. Accuracy can be higher than for hair hygrometers. These electronic devices are utilized in most modern automatic weather stations.\nThe dry and wet bulb temperatures are measured using psychrometers. Most common are those using two mercury thermometers, one of them having the bulb covered with a wick saturated with distilled water, and which measures a temperature lowered due to the evaporative cooling. When they are naturally ventilated inside a shelter, problems can arise if air flow is not sufficient to maintain an appropriate evaporation rate and associated cooling. The Assmann psychrometer has a forced ventilation of the wet bulb and dry bulb thermometers. The dry and wet bulb temperature can be measured by thermocouples or by thermistors, the so called thermocouple psychrometers and thermosound psychrometers. These psychrometers are used in automatic weather stations and, when properly maintained and operated, provide very accurate measurements. ASSESSING INTEGRITY OF WEATHER DATA2"

However, as shown for day 7, Rs may sometimes exceed the predicted Rso when there is reflection of radiation from nearby clouds during periods when no clouds shade the pyranometer.\n2 These guidelines are based on an article by Allen (1996). 3 For Ra daily computations see Chapter 3, Equations (21) - (24) and for hourly computations see\nEquations (28) - (33).

Or, an additive correction may be warranted, where (Rs)cor = Rs + c. Or, correction may be made by a combination of multiplicative and additive factors. Obviously, the corrections based on the computed Rso curves presume that the curve is accurate. The accuracy of the Rso envelope may need to be confirmed in a region by using accurate radiation measurements obtained from a calibration-grade pyranometer that has a calibration coefficient that is traceable to the international standard. The calibration pyranometer should be used only for short term periods of 10 – 14 days, and then should be stored in darkness to extend its life and to preserve the calibrated accuracy.

If measured values for Rn chronically deviate from estimated values by more than 3- 5%, then the calibration or operation of the Rn device (radiometer) should be scrutinized. This type of comparison can readily identify days or periods during which the radiometer device has malfunctioned due to effects of dust, bird droppings, moisture condensation inside the plastic domes, a lack of levelness of the intrument, or a lack of green vegetation beneath the sensor. Of course, the Rs measurement used in the Rn equations should also be scrutinized as discussed in the previous section.\nThe user of net radiometer data must be aware that net radiometers manufactured by different companies may not yield the same measurements of radiation even when placed over the same surface. These differences are due to differences in sensitivities of various radiometers to long wave and short wave radiation and variations among methods for calibrating sensors during manufacturing.\nThe type, density and height of vegetation beneath the net radiometer and relative soil moisture content should be monitored and reported with the data. Care should be exercised when positioning the radiometer to avoid shading the sensed vegetation with other instruments or structures and to insure that the radiometer is not shaded by other instruments or structures at any time of the day or year.\nFIGURE 5.2 30-minute average Rs and estimated Rso envelopes at Logan, UT during July 7 and July 25, 1992\n-2\nLogan, UT July, 1992\nJuly 7 July 25\nReflection by nearby clouds\n0 600 1200 1800 0 600 1200 1800 2400 0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\nHour of the Day\nSolar Radiation, W m\nEq. 3.13 Eq. 3.14 Eq.3.17-20\nCrop evapotranspiration\n251\nFigure 5.3 shows measured and estimated Rn for cattail vegetation near Logan, UT during 1993.

Relative humidity will vary significantly with time of day, and inversely with air temperature as shown in Figure 12 of Chapter 3. However, both Tdew and ea, either measured directly, or computed using RH and T measurements, should remain somewhat constant throughout a 24-hour period when the air mass is stable and advection of dry air from outside the area does not occur. During these stable periods, one should expect some rise in Tdew and ea during daytime periods, when ET fluxes humidify the equilibrium boundary layer. However, this increase is usually less than about 10 to 20%. Variation in Tdew increases significantly when a weather front passes overhead. Since ea is calculated as the product of RH and saturation vapour pressure at air temperature, any error in the RH calibration tends to cause false variation in Tdew and ea with changing air temperature.\nFigure 5.4 shows Tdew computed from measurements of RH and air temperature at a weather station in the center of a wetland near Logan, UT (20-minute data). Tdew generally varied from hour to hour due to air mass instability and increased during most days of this period as evaporation from the local wetland vegetation added humidity to the air. The data sequence shows some periods of relatively constant measurement (calculation) of Tdew throughout a 24-hour period (for example day of year 199), even though air temperature varied substantially. This is a good indication that the RH sensor was probably functioning correctly and that the instrument calibrations were probably valid.\nFigure 5.4 also shows, for the same weather station, a comparison between RH measured using two different and independent relative humidity sensors. The two sensors, one a “chilled-mirror” device that measures Tdew directly, and the other, a device that measures RH directly, agreed very well with each other during the 8 days shown. The value of having “redundancy” in instrumentation is demonstrated in this example, where the two different devices measuring the same parameter (in this case RH) leave no question concerning the validity and accuracy of the RH measurements, due to the close agreement. The use of only a single instrument would leave some question as to accuracy.\nOne can notice in Figure 5.4 that the RH approached 100% on day 200, which is expected for a well-watered setting. The difference between minimum daily temperature and Tdew was generally 1 to 2 oC for many of the days. This is expected in dry, advective environments, as discussed in Chapter 3 and Annex 6."

In other words, the weather data are to be measured above an extensive grass crop that is actively evapotranspiring, or in an environment with healthy vegetation not short of water1. Under these reference conditions, the energy available at the surface (Rn - G) is partitioned between sensible and latent heat (H and λE, respectively) in such a way that, in general, the ratio β = H/λEref ≤ 0.5. The subscript ref indicates reference conditions.\nEnvironmental conditions of arid lands that surround a non reference (arid) weather site do not allow for the reference rate of evapotranspiration to be attained. This is generally caused by lack of well-watered conditions. Thus, λEn/ref < λEref (subscript n/ref for non reference conditions). If the available energy (Rn - G) is the same, then the partitioning among sensible and latent heat changes, with Hn/ref > Href and, often, βn/ref > 0.5. Consequently, since air temperature increases with increasing H, the air temperatures measured at non reference sites are higher than those that would have been measured if reference conditions had existed, i.e. Tn/ref > Tref. On the contrary, humidity measured at a non reference site is lower than that which would have occurred under reference conditions, thus ea n/ref < ea ref and VPDn/ref > VPDref.\nWhen computing ETo using standard estimates for Rn - G, ra and rs, ETo will be overestimated when calculated using Tn/ref and VPDn/ref. A correction is therefore required to bring temperature and humidity data closer to the reference conditions.\nIn an environment having healthy vegetation and adequate soil moisture (reference conditions), minimum air temperature Tmin usually approaches dew point temperature, Tdew, (see Figure 6.2 for Kimberly, Idaho, the United States)2. This especially occurs if the wind dies down by early morning and when soil moisture is high (illustrated through the ratio precipitation/ETo, in Figure 6.1). Air temperatures decrease during night time due to surface cooling caused by long-wave emission and evaporation when VPD is positive. When near surface air temperature T approaches Tdew, T is prevented from decreasing below Tdew by condensation of vapour from the air and the correspondent heating effect of released latent heat. Thus, for reference conditions the relationship (Tmin)ref = (Tdew)ref is generally valid.\n1 More detailed discussions are given in Allen (1996) and Allen et al (1996). 2 However, air temperature may not decrease to the dew point when large amounts of warm and dry\nair are transported to the surface by wind.\nAnnex 6: Correction of weather data observed in non-reference weather sites to compute ETo 258\nCrop evapotranspiration\n259\nFor non reference sites, soil moisture and/or vegetation limitations make λETn/ref < λ ETref or ETn/ref < ETo. Thus Tmin may remain above Tdew. One cause of this phenomenon is the large \"reservoir\" of sensible heat created during daytime in the atmosphere (Hn/ref > Href, as suggested before), which is transferred towards the surface during the night, reducing the effect of cooling by long wave radiation. Another cause is the lack of soil moisture for evaporative cooling during night time.\nThis phenomenon can be observed in Figure 6.1, where monthly means for Tmin - Tdew\nare plotted for weather stations operated by national governments of two countries, Sudan and the United States. The data are plotted against the monthly ratios of precipitation to reference ETo. The P/ETo ratios indicate the availability of adequate soil water to support reference (well-watered) conditions in the absense of irrigation. As illustrated by the data, Tmin approaches Tdew for nearly all stations when the ratio P/ETo approaches and exceeds 1. When P/ETo < 1, then the aridity of the station causes Tmin to substantially exceed measured Tdew. The exception is for those weather stations that have P/ETo < 1, but are irrigated or have adequate soil water reserves from a prior month. The similarity between data of Sudan and the United States indicates that this is a general phenomenon.\nAn additional comparison is given in Figure 2, where Tmin - Tdew are compared for two semiarid locations in Idaho, the United States that are separated by 200 km. One location, Kimberly, is a reference site in the middle of a large irrigated area. The other, Boise, is a non reference site, located at an airport and surrounded by a mixture of irrigated and non irrigated rangeland. It can be seen that Tmin approaches Tdew frequently for the irrigated site at Kimberly, with only small differences occuring during months where a dry climate occurs (low precipitation/ETo ratio). On the contrary, Tmin was as much as 10ºC higher than Tdew for the nonreference Boise station. From this graphical comparison, one can conclude that data for the nonreference Boise site require appropriate correction before being utilized to compute ETo using the FAO - PM method. This is necessary to avoid overestimation of ETo due to overestimation of air temperature and VPD."

It is noted that in a nonreference setting, the measured Tmin may be too high, as compared to Tmin expected for a reference setting, so that Equation (6-6) may result in values for Tdew that are overestimated, even for a reference condition. However, since the computation of vapor pressure deficit, VPD, in the ETo equation, where VPD = 0.5(eo(Tmax) + eo(Tmin)) - eo(Tdew), utilizes values for air temperature and dew point temperature that may both be too high, the upward bias in all temperature parameters will tend to cancel, thereby presenting a VPD that is representative of a reference condition."

The example is in the form of a computer spreadsheet and is applied to the dry, edible bean crop that was used in example boxes 15 and 16 of Chapters 6 and 7. The spreadsheet is shown in Figure 8.1, where the irrigation schedule is determined using the daily soil-water balance procedure described in Chapter 8. The timing of irrigations is based on the management allowed depletion (MAD) of the available water that can be stored in the root zone. The irrigation schedule and the corresponding estimated wet soil evaporation are different from the actual values shown in Box 16 of Chapter 7, since Box 16 represents the actual irrigation schedule used at Kimberly during 1974. The actual schedule deviated somewhat from the theoretical schedule of Figure 8.1. The spreadsheet formulas used for calculations and the references to equations in the text are indicated in Box 8.1. The variable names used for parameters follow the same convention used in Chapters 1 to 9. The variable names are defined in the List of principal symbols and acronymns in the introduction to this paper. A few exceptions are defined in Table 8.1.\nThe spreadsheet in Figure 8.1 includes columns for variables Tmax, u2, and Tdew. The Tmax and Tdew columns are used to calculate daily RHmin. The u2 and RHmin columns are used to adjust Kcb mid and Kcb end using Equation 70 of Chapter 7 and to calculate Kc max using Equation 72 on a daily basis. The data in the first 7 rows of Figure 8.1 that appear within boxes represent the specific crop and soils information that is entered by the user for a particular crop and soil combination. All other information (outside of boxes) is calculated automatically by the spreadsheet program. The columns having double underlined headings represent the data that are input by the user into the spreadsheet. The calculations in Figure 8.1 can be used to verify other computer programs or spreadsheet calculations for Ke, Kc and ETc. Small differences may result, depending on the assumptions of timing of irrigations. The spreadsheet of Figure 8.1 presumes that all irrigation and precipitation events occur early in the morning. The scheduling and magnitudes of irrigations are based on the soil water depletion at the end of the previous day. The spreadsheet also presumes that all drainage from the root zone due to excess precipitation occurs on the day of the precipitation event. It is assumed that runoff from precipitation is zero. If necessary, procedures for predicting precipitation runoff can be entered into the spreadsheet using procedures described in most standard hydrology textbooks. It is assumed that the net depth of irrigation that is retained in the crop root zone is exactly equal to the depletion depth of the previous day. This assumption presumes perfect knowledge of soil water depletion by the irrigator or that all irrigations are adequate or excessive. This assumption may not hold for some irrigation conditions and can be changed by the user as needed.\nAnnex 8:Calculation example for applying the dual Kc procedure in irrigation scheduling 270\nSpreadsheet formulas used to create the spreadsheet of Figure 8.1 are listed in Box 8.1 for the Microsoft Excel language (versions 5 and higher).

Footnotes: (1) Cells K8 and K9 use the vertical lookup function to automatically calculate the average wind\nspeed and average daily minimum relative humidity during the midseason period. The lookup function uses cumulative totals of wind speed and RHmin that are calculated in columns AO and AP.\n(2) The formula to calculate Kcb for each day uses a series of imbedded IF statements to determine which growing period the day is in. Linear interpolation is applied when the day is within the development and late season growing periods.\n(3) The crop height on any day is calculated as proportional to the value of Kcb on that day to the Kcb mid value, multiplied by the maximum crop height that has been entered by the user in cell M5. The value for crop height is not allowed to decrease with time. Hence, the MAX() function is employed, comparing with the value of the previous day.\n(4) The value for irrigation depth (divided by fw to express the depth over the wetted fraction of the soil, only) is presumed to occur early in the day. This value is based on a decision made at the end of the previous day (column AH), based on whether or not the ending soil water depletion on the previous day has exceeded the readily available water (RAW). The irrigation depth on the first day is presumed to be zero.\n(5) The value for fw is determined according to the last occurrence of precipitation or irrigation, as described in Chapter 7.\n(6) The depletion of the evaporation layer (top soil layer) at the beginning of the day is presumed to equal the depletion at the end of the previous day less any precipitation or irrigation, which is assumed to occur very early in the day. The value for De,i is limited to ≥ 0.\nThe depletion of the evaporation layer at the end of the day is calculated according to Eq. 77, with root extraction of plant transpiration from the evaporation layer assumed to equal zero.\n(7) The value for Kc is calculated as Kc = Kcb + Ke and the value for ETc is calculated as Kc x ETo. (8) The depth of the effective root zone on any day is calculated as being proportional to the ratio of\nthe value of the Kcb on that day (above the value of Kc min) to the Kcb mid – Kc min, as described in Eq. 1 of this annex. The rooting depth is not allowed to decrease with time. Therefore, the MAX() function is utilised, where the value for the previous day is compared.\n(9) The “first” estimate for ending depletion of the root zone (Dr,,i) is estimated using Eq. 85, with drainage assumed to be zero and with ETc for nonstressed conditions. The value for Dr, i is then recalculated in Column AK, after any drainage loss is estimated and after any reduction in ETc, to account for low soil water content. The value for Dr, i in column AK represents depletion of the root zone at the end of the day.\n(10) The net depth of irrigation needed is based on the value of soil water depletion at the end of the day. It is assumed that irrigation will be applied at the beginning of the following day. The formula in column AH checks to insure that the specific day is within the growing period. The formula assumes that no irrigation will be desired during the last one-half of the late-season period. This assumption may need to be modified for some other crops. The value for management allowed depletion is allowed to have a different (normally higher) value during the initial period as compared to during the rest of the growing season.\n(11) The stress coefficient Ks represents the Ks under the current conditions of soil water. The value for Ks is reduced below 1.0 using Eq. 84 if the depletion of the root zone (following any irrigation or precipitation earlier in the day) is greater than the readily available water (RAW). It is presumed that the stress point, p, is the same as the value entered for MAD. This presumption can be modified as needed.\n(12) Columns AO and AP contain cumulative sums of daily wind speed and daily minimum relative humidity. These columns are used to calculate mean values for u2 and RHmin during the midseason period (footnote 1).\nAnnex 8:Calculation example for applying the dual Kc procedure in irrigation scheduling 278\nThe daily values calculated for Kcb and Kc are illustrated in Figure 8.2. The daily soil water depletion at the end of each day calculated in the spreadsheet example is graphed in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.3 illustrates the effect of an increasing root zone on the allowable depletion. The allowable depletion is the same as the readily available water (RAW) when it is assumed that MAD = p, the evapotranspiration depletion factor. The depth of the effective root zone is calculated on each day as:"

Equations 8-1 and 8-2 presume that the development of the root zone increases in proportion to the increase in Kcb.

Other approaches to estimate Zr can be used, including interpolations based on time of season, for example:\n( ) startmax start minrmaxrminrir JJ JJ ZZZZ − − −+= for Jstart ≤ J ≤ Jmax (8-3)\nand Zr i = Zr min when J < Jstart, and Zr i = Zr max when J > Jmax, where: Jstart Day of year at beginning of the increase in Zr i beyond Zr min Jmax Day of year at the attainment of maximum rooting depth Zr min for annual crops should represent the depth of seed placement plus an additional depth of soil that may contribute water to the seed as it extends its initial roots downward following germination. For many annual crops, Zr min can be be estimated as 0.15 to 0.20 m. The value used for MAD is given a separate and larger value during the initial period to account for the ability of roots for some crops to extract water at relatively dry water contents during germination and during the initial period with little impact by stress. In this example, it is assumed that p =MAD. The irrigation period for the bean crop is presumed to begin at planting and to terminate half-way through the late season period. Therefore, the last irrigation date is on day"

(3) (P-RO) are known values after the occurrence of the day, during an update of the calculations. (4) Net irrigation depth for the part of the soil surface wetted by irrigation. (5) (1-fc) is given (interpolated between 0.92 m on day 1 and 0.86 m on day 10). (6) If significant rain: fw,i = 1.0 (Tab. 20) If irrigation: fw,i = 0.8 (given), otherwise: fw,i = fw,i-1. (7) Eq. 75. Fraction of soil surface from which most evaporation occurs. (8) Kcb is given (interpolated between 0.30 on day 1 and 0.40 on day 10). (9) De,i start (depletion at start of day) If precipitation and irrigation occur early in the day then the status of depletion from the soil surface layer (at the start of the day) should be updated: = Max(De,i-1 - In,i/fwi - (P-RO)i , or 0). where De,i-1 is taken from column 14 of previous day. If P and I occur late in the day, then col (6) should be set equal to De,i-1 (col. (14) of previous day). (10) If De,i ≤ REW then Kr = 1 If De,i > REW then Kr = Eq. 74. (11) Eq. 71 where Ke = Kr (Kc max - Kcb) ≤ few Kc max. (e.g., Ke = min(Kr (Kc max - Kcb), few Kc max). (12) Evaporation from the wetted and exposed fraction of the soil surface = (Ke ETo)/few. (13) Eq. 79 where DPe ≥ 0. (This is deep percolation from the evaporating layer). In this example, even though\nP and I are assumed to occur early in the day, and DPe and De,i end are calculated for the end of the day, DPe from the surface layer is presumed to occur shortly after the wetting event and is therefore based on the De,i.end for the previous day (De,I-1).\n)\n(14) De,i (depletion at end of day) is from Eq. 77 where De,i-1 is the value in column 14 of previous day. (15) Mean evaporation expressed as distributed over the entire field surface = Ke ETo. (16) Kc = Kcb + Ke. (17) Eq. 69. Note that values in col. (9)-(11), and (14)-(17) will change slightly if values for col. (5) and (8) are entered as printed, due to exact internal interpolation for (5) and (8) in the actual calculation spreadsheet, or if values for col. (9) and (14) are rounded each calculation, rather than carried as exact values internal to the spreadsheet used to create the table.\nETc under soil water stress conditions 172\nEXAMPLE 38 (corrected by errata, Feb. 2006) Irrigation scheduling to avoid crop water stress Plan the irrigation applications for Example 35. It is assumed that: - irrigations are to be applied when RAW is depleted,\n- the depletion factor (p) is 0.6,\n- all irrigations and precipitations occur early in the day,\n- the depth of the root zone (Zr) on day 1 is 0.3 m and increases to 0.36 m by day 12,\n- the root zone depletion at the beginning of day 1 (Dr,i-1) is RAW.

(2) From Example 35. (3) Zr is given (interpolated between 0.3 m on day 1 and 0.36 m on day 12). (4) Eq. 83. (5) Dr,i start (root zone depletion at the beginning of the day) If precipitation and irrigation occur early in the day then Dr,i start = Max(Dr,i-1 end - I - (P-RO), or 0) If precipitation and irrigation occur late in the day, then Dr,i start = Dr,i-1end where Dr,i-1end is taken from column 14 of previous day Since the depth of the root zone increases each day, the water content of the subsoil (θsub) has\nto be considered to update Dr,i Dr,i = Dr,i-1 + 1 000 (θFC - θsub,i-1) ∆Zr,I The example assumes that θsub is at field capacity (due to prior overirrigation and excessive rainfall on previous days). Therefore, a combination of the equations for Dr,i can be utilized.\n(6) From Example 35. (7) Irrigation is required when Dr,i ≥ RAW. On day 1, the irrigation depth (infiltrating the soil) is given from Example 35 as I = 40 mm. On day 12, a second irrigation is required. An irrigation with a net depth of 28 mm refills the root zone and avoids water loss by deep percolation (DP = 0 mm). (8) Eq. 84, where Ks = 1 for Dr,i ≤ RAW. (9) From Example 35. (10) Day 1 to 10: From Example 35. Day 11: Kr =0.033 and Ke = 0.033 (1.21 – 0.41) = 0.03\nDay 12: Following the extra irrigation early in the day, the topsoil will be wet and Kr is 1 and from Eq. 71: Ke = 1.0 (1.21 - 0.42) = 0.79.\n(11) Kc = Ks Kcb + Ke. (12) Eq. 80. (13) Eq. 88, where Dr,i-1 is taken from column 14 of previous day. In this example, because P and I are\nassumed to occur early in the day, and DP and Dr,i end are calculated for the end of the day, ET during the day reduces I and P to some extent so that contributions to DP are reduced. This differs from the assumption in Ex. 35 for the more shallow evaporation layer.\n(14) Dr,i (root zone depletion at end of one day) is used as the starting Dr,i at the beginning of the next day (see footnote 5). From Eq. 85, where Dr,i-1 is taken from column 14 of previous day. Note that values in some columns will change slightly if values for col. (9) and (10) are entered as printed in Example 35, rather than linked from the calculation spreadsheet from Example 35, due to exact internal calculations in the spreadsheet where values are not rounded.\nETc under soil water stress conditions 174"
