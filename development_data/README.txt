Needed:
 [x] papers related to crop models (3)
         >> ASCE_PT_model_papers/
 [x] the one page of the one paper Adarsh referenced
         >> petpt_equations_example.pdf
         >> used sketchy online OCR tool (https://www.onlineocr.net) to make petpt_equations_example.txt
            >> petpt_example_edited.txt has been manually edited
        >> used tesseract to make: petpt_equations_example.tesseract.txt

    [ ] the paper the page came from
    [ ] equations (cropped images)
    [ ] text surrounding equations

 [ ] GrFN for THIS model
    [ ] retrieve the variables
    [ ] retrieve the comments
        [x] RAW
            >> petpt_extracted_comments.{txt | json}
            These files were generated using the `get_comments.py` script from the delphi repo that is located at `delphi/translators/for2py/scripts/`. The script can be run with a provided path to a Fortran file and the extracted comments will be be output in JSON form
    [ ] hopefully, we can use the variables to find the relevant comments

 [ ] Print out page, highlight, manually determine what we want (whiteboard)

  TODO:
   [ ] collect stuff
