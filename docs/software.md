The machine reading of the scientific papers is done using a tool built upon
[processors](https://github.com/clulab/processors), the parsing of equations in
PDFs of scientific papers is done using the
[equation parser module]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/equation_reading/), and the program
analysis and model assembly is performed by
[Delphi](https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi).
