title: Equation Parser
---

This package aims to allow for the extraction and parsing of equations in PDFs
of technical and scientific documents. It utilizes techniques from both computer
vision and natural language processing to identify the equations and to ground
their variables to scientific concepts.

In the bigger picture, the package serves as a proof of concept for extracting
information stored in the form of structured objects (including equations,
tables, and charts) in PDF documents.

This module is being developed as part of the
[AutoMATES](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates/) project at the University of
Arizona.
