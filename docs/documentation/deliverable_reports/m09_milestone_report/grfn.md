## Updates to GrFN

Link to the [month 9 report release version (v0.1.m9) of the GrFN specification](GrFN_specification_v0.1.m9).

During this phase there were modest changes to the GrFN spec, with the main work on GrFN coming in the form of planning for converting the GrFN specification to [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) schema. The new version will be released with the month 11 report.

The following are changes made to GrFN this phase:

* The introduction of *identifiers*, including `<identifier_spec>`, `<identifier_string>` and `<gensym>` (to denote identifiers in generated code)
* Revised the introduction to reflect the new changes and clarify some topics.
* Updates to naming conventions for variables and functions
* General cleanup of discussion throughout.
