The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).

However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period.

A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.

That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health.

We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same</td>\n",

Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.</td>\n",

We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses.

       "      <td>background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data.</td>\n",

We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations):</td>\n",

It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi-</td>\n",

Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval.

This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.</td>\n",

It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that</td>\n",

On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development.</td>\n",

The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Case a First, we assume that IP(0) = 0.5 million, that is 0.5 mil- lion  Hong  Kong  people  are  infected  by  disease  B.  This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011.</td>\n",

The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP.</td>\n",

Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1    There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0>1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "11   Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period.

       "19   An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "37   While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "38   Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "47   Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions.

       "69   Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "72   Results: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "74   background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "79   Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "84   Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "89   The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "96   The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "112  We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "113  A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "117  increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "119  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.

       "128  the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "130  Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "153  Case a First, we assume that IP(0) = 0.5 million, that is 0.5 mil- lion  Hong  Kong  people  are  infected  by  disease  B.  This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "159  Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "162  Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "164  Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "177  In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models.

The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0&gt;1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the Figure 1 Typical dynamics for the SIR model Typical dynamics for the SIR model.   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be 25 20 Observed three-day mean cases per day 15 Predicted cases (I*a) 10 5 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 14 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Figure 7 Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days. dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

The  usual number of social contacts of a person is in general higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong while lower in remote area like Inner Mongolia.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of 03/17 03/23 03/29 04/04 04/10 04/16 04/22 04/28 05/04 05/10 s 1000 e s a 800 c  f o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 smaller than the previous case.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r &gt;rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\" Figure 3 Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\". SEIR model evolution (in red) is much slower (and thus may seam less severe) but reaches the same final size of epidemic. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) &gt; 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP &gt; 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  &gt;  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: Page 6 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.</td>\n",

Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0&gt;1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the Figure 1 Typical dynamics for the SIR model Typical dynamics for the SIR model.   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be 25 20 Observed three-day mean cases per day 15 Predicted cases (I*a) 10 5 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 14 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Figure 7 Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days. dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of 03/17 03/23 03/29 04/04 04/10 04/16 04/22 04/28 05/04 05/10 s 1000 e s a 800 c  f o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 smaller than the previous case.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r &gt;rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\" Figure 3 Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\". SEIR model evolution (in red) is much slower (and thus may seam less severe) but reaches the same final size of epidemic. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) &gt; 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP &gt; 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  &gt;  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: Page 6 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.</td>\n",

Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0&gt;1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the Figure 1 Typical dynamics for the SIR model Typical dynamics for the SIR model.   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.

We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of 03/17 03/23 03/29 04/04 04/10 04/16 04/22 04/28 05/04 05/10 s 1000 e s a 800 c  f o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 smaller than the previous case.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r &gt;rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\" Figure 3 Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\". SEIR model evolution (in red) is much slower (and thus may seam less severe) but reaches the same final size of epidemic. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) &gt; 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP &gt; 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  &gt;  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: Page 6 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.</td>\n",

Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0>1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the Figure 1 Typical dynamics for the SIR model Typical dynamics for the SIR model.   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be 25 20 Observed three-day mean cases per day 15 Predicted cases (I*a) 10 5 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 14 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Figure 7 Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days. dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

The  usual number of social contacts of a person is in general higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong while lower in remote area like Inner Mongolia.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of 03/17 03/23 03/29 04/04 04/10 04/16 04/22 04/28 05/04 05/10 s 1000 e s a 800 c  f o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 smaller than the previous case.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r >rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\" Figure 3 Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\". SEIR model evolution (in red) is much slower (and thus may seam less severe) but reaches the same final size of epidemic. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) > 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP > 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  >  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t).

Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.   \n",
       "1  relation  rS(t0)  =  a  holds.  Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0>1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the Figure 1 Typical dynamics for the SIR model Typical dynamics for the SIR model.   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be 25 20 Observed three-day mean cases per day 15 Predicted cases (I*a) 10 5 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 14 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Figure 7 Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days. dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

The  usual number of social contacts of a person is in general higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong while lower in remote area like Inner Mongolia.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of 03/17 03/23 03/29 04/04 04/10 04/16 04/22 04/28 05/04 05/10 s 1000 e s a 800 c  f o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 smaller than the previous case.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r >rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\" Figure 3 Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\". SEIR model evolution (in red) is much slower (and thus may seam less severe) but reaches the same final size of epidemic. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) > 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP > 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  >  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: Page 6 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.   \n",

Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0>1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel.

These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be 25 20 Observed three-day mean cases per day 15 Predicted cases (I*a) 10 5 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 14 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Figure 7 Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days. dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

The  usual number of social contacts of a person is in general higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong while lower in remote area like Inner Mongolia.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of 03/17 03/23 03/29 04/04 04/10 04/16 04/22 04/28 05/04 05/10 s 1000 e s a 800 c  f o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 smaller than the previous case.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r >rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

Our  model would  then  be  useful  to  enforce  proper  precautionary measures immediately. Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge helpful discussions with Prof. B.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) > 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP > 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  >  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: Page 6 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.   \n",

       "      <td>relation  rS(t0)  =  a  holds.  Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0&gt;1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the Figure 1 Typical dynamics for the SIR model Typical dynamics for the SIR model.   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.

We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dI = 0 .  It  follows  from  the  equation  SIR-2  that  the dt dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r &gt;rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\" Figure 3 Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\". SEIR model evolution (in red) is much slower (and thus may seam less severe) but reaches the same final size of epidemic. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) &gt; 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP &gt; 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  &gt;  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. tributed exponentially with mean equals to e-as ds = 1/a. 0 ∞∫ In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: Page 6 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.</td>\n",

Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase. There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0>1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9].  Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the Figure 1 Typical dynamics for the SIR model Typical dynamics for the SIR model.   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.   http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Page 3 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes)  s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single Figure 11 Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia Number of SARS cases per day in Inner Mongolia. epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be 25 20 Observed three-day mean cases per day 15 Predicted cases (I*a) 10 5 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 14 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Figure 7 Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days Number of SARS cases in Hong-Kong community (and the simulated case \"b\") per three days. dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.

The  usual number of social contacts of a person is in general higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong while lower in remote area like Inner Mongolia.

While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 10 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N the total people infected with the SARS virus (that is R∞) at the level of 2700. 1200 Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of 0 03/17 03/23 03/29 04/04 04/10 04/16 04/22 04/28 05/04 05/10 s 1000 e s a 800 c  f o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 smaller than the previous case.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation Tuen Wai Ng*1, Gabriel Turinici2,3 and Antoine Danchin4 Research article © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Received: 23 May 2003 Accepted: 10 September 2003 Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3:19 background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which dI = 0 .  It  follows  from  the  equation  SIR-2  that  the dt dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 2 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Figure 2 Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens Daily new number of confirmed SARS cases from Hong Kong: hospital, community and the Amoy Gardens. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000.

The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 9 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Note that in Hong Kong, r >rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\" Figure 3 Comparison of the SEIR (red) and SIR (green) models with the same parameters \"r\" and \"a\". SEIR model evolution (in red) is much slower (and thus may seam less severe) but reaches the same final size of epidemic. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 Page 5 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.  Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the Figure 10 Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia Cumulative number of SARS cases in Inner Mongolia. 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N Page 13 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) > 0). Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). BMC Infectious Diseases 2003, 3 Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Page 7 of 16 (page number not for citation purposes) (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP > 0 is a constant. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/19 (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  >  0  is  a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. tributed exponentially with mean equals to e-as ds = 1/a. 0 ∞∫ In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t).

Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram.   \n",

       "      <td>Abstract Background: An  epidemic  of a Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome  (SARS)  caused  by a new coronavirus has spread from the Guangdong province to the rest of China and to the world, with a puzzling contagion behavior. It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- Results: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down. loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which relation  rS(t0)  =  a  holds.  Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase.</td>\n",

These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).

       "      <td>There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0&gt;1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9]. Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000. Suppose we increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section. As will be discussed at the end of this paper an outbreak of  infections  caused  by  a  coronavirus  and  its  mutants [1,10] provided hints that epidemics that superimpose on each other might account for the situation we are witness- ing at several places in the world. A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram. E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  &gt;  0  is  a constant. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP &gt; 0 is a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) &gt; 0). -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case a First, we assume that IP(0) = 0.5 million, that is 0.5 mil- lion  Hong  Kong  people  are  infected  by  disease  B.  This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much smaller than the previous case. Therefore disease B needs to spread much faster in order to \"protect\" people from being infected by SARS.</td>\n",

The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases.

The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the values of a and b for all the different scenarios before the parameters r, rP and aP are chosen to fit the data. The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Note that in Hong Kong, r &gt;rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia. One possible reason for these differences is that the values of r and rP depend on how  the  daily  contact  patterns  of  people.  The  usual number of social contacts of a person is in general higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong while lower in remote area like Inner Mongolia. This may explain the dif- ference of the r and rP values in these cases. 1200 s 1000 e s Observed a 800 c  f Expected o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 0 Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease. In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be much larger than suspected and SARS may happen again when  the  weather  cools  down  in  autumn.  Our  model would  then  be  useful  to  enforce  proper  precautionary measures immediately. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. GT contributed to the derivation of the differential equa- tions that describe the model, carried out numerical sim- ulations and the parameter fitting procedures. AD provided the biological background for setting up the model and proposed, based on the 1983–1985 outbreak of coronavirus infection in European pigs the \"double epi- demic\" hypothesis.

Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.</td>\n",

       "4   Abstract Background: An  epidemic  of a Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome  (SARS)  caused  by a new coronavirus has spread from the Guangdong province to the rest of China and to the world, with a puzzling contagion behavior. It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Background Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of  a  very  contagious  atypical  pneumonia  (now  named Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)  initiated  in  the Guangdong  Province  of  China.  This  outbreak  started  a world-wide  epidemic  after  a  medical  doctor  from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow- Results: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to  be  inconsistent,  suggesting  that  they  are  incomplete  or  do  not  reflect  an  appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down. loon  around  February  21st,  2003  (SAR  Hong  Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pat- tern  of  the  outbreak  became  puzzling  after  an  estate  in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected  by  the  virus  apparently  causing  the  disease.  In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak  there  remained  a  more  or  less  constant background  infection  level,  that  remained  present  in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local out- breaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic  pattern  for  reasons  that  have  to  be  analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics  that  affected  pigs  in  the  1983  –1985  [1]  we chose  to  explore  here  the  consequences  of  a  situation where  two  overlapping  epidemics  interfere  with  each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation  and  recombination  rate  of  coronaviruses  [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple  mutations  [3].  There  are  two  epidemics,  one epidemic  is  SARS  caused  by  a  coronavirus  virus,  call  it virus  A.  Another  epidemic,  which  may  have  appeared before  SARS,  is  assumed  to  be  extremely  contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innoc- uousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro- enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had  diarrhoea  for  about  one  day,  during  this  winter  in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recom- bination  event  from  virus  B  [4–6].  We  also  explore  the possible  situation  where  viruses  A  and  B  would  be  of totally  different  origin,  but  would  cause  an  overlapping immune  response  of  the  host.  Both  epidemics  would spread  in  parallel,  and  it  can  be  expected  that  the  epi- demic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, pro- tects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the  epidemic  B  can  get  SARS  large  outbreaks).  Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epi- demic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puz- zling  distribution  of  the  disease  in  Mainland  China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight  and  frequent  contacts  with  Guangdong  and  Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer con- clusions  on  the  accuracy  of  available  epidemiological data. which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities. Review on the standard SIR model Consider a disease that, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead individuals  are  still counted). We assume that there is no entry into or depar- ture  from  the  population.  The  population  can  then  be divided into three distinct classes; the susceptibles, S, who can catch the disease; the infectives, I, who have the dis- ease and can transmit it; and the removed class, R, namely those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovered. Here we follow the definition of the class R given in [8]. However, we would like to draw the readers' attention that this definition of the class R is different from those given in [7], [11] which do  not  include  isolated  infectives  in  the  class  R.  The progress of individuals is schematically described by S → I → R. Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the number of individuals in each of the corresponding class at time t. Note that usu- ally only  R(t) can be known. It is often considered that R(t)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  patients  admitted  to hospitals. With some reasonable assumptions (which will be explained in details in the next section), we can show that these three functions are governed by the following system of  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  (see next  section  for  the  derivation  of  these  differential equations): dS SIR- 1 rS t I t = − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dI SIR-2 rS t I t aI t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR SIR-3 aI t = ( )) ( ) dt where  r  is  the  infection  rate  and  a  the  removal  rate  of infectives. The parameters r and a characterize the propa- gation  of  the  disease  and  can  also  be  used  as  control parameters in order to stop the epidemic. In general, the functions S, I and R behave as the three curves in Figure 1. The characteristics of these curves are as follow. Results In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  epidemic  model  to study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in  China.  We  begin  with  a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is sim- ple and useful when one tries to understand the propaga- tion of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motiva- tions of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties -  S  decreases  monotonically  from  its  initial  value  to  its final  value,  while  R  increases  monotonically  until  it reaches the limiting value R∞. Both curves have two dis- tinct periods where the decrease (or increase) is exponen- tially slow or exponentially fast. - The function I first increases exponentially and reaches the maximum value at time t0 and then decreases to zero. The time t0 is the critical point of the function I at which relation  rS(t0)  =  a  holds.  Note  that  since  R  is  available from the observations, it follows that the values of I can dR be estimated from the relation (up to the I t ⋅1 ( ) = a dt unknown multiplicative parameter a). Knowing whether the I has reached its maximum value can be used by the health  authorities  as  a  criterion  to  determine  if  the  epi- demic has entered the decay (extinction) phase.

       "6   time  he  died,  he  had  infected  10  guests  who  had  been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subse- quently  responsible  for  major  outbreaks  in  hospitals  in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. Figure 2 shows the daily new number of confirmed SARS cases in Hong Kong from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (source: Hong Kong SAR Government press release, http:/ /www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm). The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gar- dens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph dR can be considered as an approximation of . The graph dt has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take  away  those  cases  from  the  hospital  staff  and  the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose  values  are  within  a  narrow  range  (say  15  to  25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there  is  a  fixed  period  between  exposure  and  becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model).  Thus,  rather  than  an  exposed  susceptible

       "7   There are two important figures one would like to know from the SIR model. First, the limiting value R∞, called the total  size  of  the  epidemic  which  is  the  total  number  of people having the disease at the end of the epidemic. Sec- ond, R0 = r/a, the basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host popula- tion where everyone is susceptible. For many determinis- tic epidemic models, an infection can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0>1. For the other aspects of the SIR model, the reader may consult refs [7,8] and [9]. Even though the SIR model provides a general framework to understand the spread of a disease, it may be too simple to accurately model a real epidemic like the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guang- dong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the s e s a c  f o  r e b m u N becoming  immediately  infectious,  it  enters  the  Exposed class,  labeled  E,  remaining  there  a  fixed  period  of  time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and compli- dR cated I, R and curves. It is also possible to produce a dt I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a rela- tively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R∞. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic  is  the  same  in  the  two  models;  however  the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of  admissions  per  day  will  result  in  a  higher  total  epi- demic  size  for  the  SEIR  model  than  for  the  SIR  model because  of  the  Exposed  class  which  is  \"hidden\"  in  the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contribut- ing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illus- tration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a. The  parameters  estimations  are  very  crucial  when  one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can  result  in  a  large  difference  in  the  values  of  R∞.  For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions  (e.g.  the  case  of  Hong  Kong)  and  an  initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 × 10-8, then R∞ is about 5,000. Suppose we increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 × 10- 8,  then  R∞  will  become  116464.  This  sensitivity  in  the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect  to  a  hypothetical  much  smaller  population,  the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model  for  which  the  effective  population,  i.e.  the  total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is pro- tected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination  against  another  disease  can  protect  people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different,  but  similar,  disease  that  spread  before  (or  is spreading  simultaneously  with  SARS)  has  immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surpris- ing SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low  hygiene  conditions.  Based  on  this  hypothesis,  we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section. As will be discussed at the end of this paper an outbreak of  infections  caused  by  a  coronavirus  and  its  mutants [1,10] provided hints that epidemics that superimpose on each other might account for the situation we are witness- ing at several places in the world. A Double Epidemic SEIRP Model Motivated by the above considerations we shall introduce a new epidemic model here to describe a double epidemic interaction. This new model will be called SEIRP model (E stands for the Exposed class while P stands for protection) which can be considered as a variant of the standard SIR. Other variants of the SIR model can be found in 17. We shall show here that by choosing the parameters carefully, the solution of the system of non-linear differential equa- tions  governing  the  SEIRP  model  can  decay  extremely slowly and therefore remains almost constant for a long time interval. This may explain the fact that a more or less constant  background  infection  level  can  be  maintained (eg in Hong Kong or in Guangdong), on which superim- poses large local outbreaks. We  assume  that  two  groups  of  infected  individuals  are introduced into a large population. One group is infected by virus A and the other group by virus B. One would like to describe the spread of the infection within the popula- tion as a function of time. This will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the actual disease involved, but as a first attempt to model directly transmitted diseases we make some reasonable general assumptions. Assume both diseases which, after recovery, confers immunity (which includes  deaths:  dead  individuals  are  still  counted).  We assume that there is no entry into or departure from the population. The population can then be divided into six distinct classes. The class of Susceptibles, S, are those who can  catch  the  disease  A  or  disease  B.  A  susceptible  who catches the disease A first will enter the Exposed class E which  includes  those  in  the  latent  period,  who  are infected  by  disease  A  but  not  yet  infectious.  After  the latent  period  ends,  the  individual  enters  the  class  I  of infectives, which includes those who have the disease A and can transmit it. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the Removed class R, namely those who are either recovered from disease A, immune or isolated until  recovered  from  disease.  A  susceptible  who  catches the disease B first will enter the class IP of infectives and then the Removed class RP. It is assumed that catching dis- ease B first will protect the individual from catching dis- ease  A.  The  progress  of  individuals  is  schematically described by the following diagram. E I R → (cid:47) → S (cid:50) I R → p p With, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) IP(t) and RP(t) as the number of individuals in each class at time t, we assume here that: (i) There is no entry into or departure from the popula- tion, except possibly through death from the disease. (ii) The gain in the exposed class E is at a rate proportional to the number of people in the infective class I and that of the  susceptibles  S,  that  is  rS(t)I(t),  where  r  >  0  is  a constant. (iii) The gain in the infective class IP is at a rate propor- tional to the number of people in the infective class IP and that of the susceptibles S, that is rPS(t)IP(t), where rP > 0 is a constant. (viii) The incubation period (the time from first infection to the appearances of symptoms) plus the onset to admis- sion interval is equal to the sum of the latent period and the infectious period and is therefore equal to 1/b + 1/a. We now assume the various classes as uniformly mixed: that  is  each  pair  of  individuals  has  equal  probability  of coming into contact with one another. The model mech- anism is then governed by the following system of non- linear ordinary differential equations: dS 1 rS t I t r S t I t p p = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) ( ) dt dE 2 rS t I t bE t = ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dI bbE t aI t 3 = ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR aI t 4 = ( ) ( ) dt dI P r S t I t a I t 5 = P P P P ( ) ( ) − ( ) ( ) dt dR PP a I t = P P ( ) ( )6 dt The  above  system  of  differential  equations  are  derived from the so-called simple mass action incidence approach which is described in [11]. The interpretation of the con- stant  r  is  as  follows.  An  average  infective  of  disease  A makes contact sufficient to transmit infection with rN oth- ers per unit time, where N is the total population. Note that the probability that a random contact by an infective with a susceptible, who can then transmit infection, is S/ N, therefore the number of new infections in unit time is (rN)(S/N)I = rSI. One can also interpret rP in a similar way. Here r and rP are related to the infection rate of disease A and B respectively, while a, aP and b are the removal rate of individuals in class I, IP and E respectively. The last two equations  follow  from  the  assumption  that  the  popula- tion size N is constant. We are, of course, only interested in non-negative solutions for S, E, I,R, IP and RP. (iv) The susceptibles are therefore lost at the rate rS(t)I(t) + rPS(t)IP(t). (v)  The  rate  of  removal  of  the  people  in  class  E  to  the infective class I is proportional to the number of people in class E, that is bE(t), where b is a positive number. It can be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people  remaining  in  the exposed class E s time unit after entering class E is e-bs, so the length of the latent period is distributed exponentially with mean equals to e-bs ds = 1/b (c.f. [11]). 0 ∞∫ (vi)  The  rate  of  removal  of  infectives  in  class  I  to  the removed  class  R  is  proportional  to  the  number  of infectives  in  class  I,  that  is  aI(t),  where  a  is  a  positive number.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  fraction  of  people remaining in the infective class I s time unit after entering class I is e-as, so the length of the infectious period is dis- ∞∫ (vii) The rate of removal of people in infective class IP to the removal class RP is proportional to the number of peo- ple in class IP, that is aPIP(t), where aPis a positive number. In the SEIRP model, there is no latency for the disease B. The inclusion of the latency for the disease B will imply the introduction of one additional parameter bP and will further complicate the model. Since the main purpose of the paper is to provide some indirect evidence that a dou- ble epidemic may exist, our simpler model may already be good  enough  for  this  purpose  because  of  the  following reasons. Firstly, even if the diseases A and B are generated from similar viruses, they can still be quite different (for instance at the level of the physical location of the infec- tion) and therefore they need not share similar models. Secondly, since  we  only  want  to  study  phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (SIR  or  SEIR-like)  spread  of  the  protective  disease  B  are less  important  that  those  of  the  propagation  of  the epidemic A. Of course, future studies may try to analyze at a finer level the spread of the protective epidemic once its existence  and  characteristics  have  been  assessed  in practice. Note that two types of protections \"static\" and \"dynamic\" can  be  seen  as  particular  cases  of  a  double  epidemic model: - the \"static\" protection is given by a protective epidemic (that has already finished its spreading) or a vaccine leav- ing some of the population immune; this amounts to only consider a fraction of the initial population in the Suscep- tibles class S (and to set IP(0) = 0 because the spread has already  taken  place);  equivalently  this  can  be  imple- mented by putting at the initial time some of the popula- tion in the Removed class R (i.e., R(0) > 0). -  the  \"dynamic\"  protection  is  when  the  protective  epi- demic spreads at the same time with the SARS giving rise to various interference patterns. One may wonder if the \"dynamic\" protection assumption is really necessary to get a good fit of the data. We have tested  the  \"static\"  protection  assumption  by  setting  the total population to several initial values less than the real population  (see  also  the  case  a)  of  Hong-Kong  simula- tions below) but the fit quality was generally less satisfac- tory  than  in  the  case  of  the  co-existing  epidemics  (i.e. \"dynamic\" effect) ; more testing is needed to fully certify this conclusion. accept that A can be derived from B, after a mutation and/ or recombination event. Since we do not know how many Hong Kong people are infected by virus B, we shall con- sider  the  following  two  scenarios:  a)  0.5  million  Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. b) only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. Case a First, we assume that IP(0) = 0.5 million, that is 0.5 mil- lion  Hong  Kong  people  are  infected  by  disease  B.  This assumption  is  quite  reasonable  because  we  believe  that disease B is caused by a gastro-enteritis virus which is usu- ally  highly  contagious.  Since  the  population  of  Hong Kong is about 6.8 million, we therefore assume that S(0) = 6.8 – 0.5 = 6.3 million. We then assume rather arbitrar- ily that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. With these initial condi- tions,  we  tried  to  search  the  parameter  values  by  a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The result is if we use the parameter values r = 10.19 × 10-8, rP = 7.079 × 10- 8, a = 0.47, aP = 0.461 and b = 0.103, then the resulting curve for R fits very well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the community. We fit the model with the total number of confirmed cases from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 4 is the curve for R, while figure 5 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1011. Recall that the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission can be estimated by 1/a + 1/b. If we take a = 0.47 and b = 0.103, then 1/a + 1/b = 11.83. On the other hand, from the statistics obtained in, the observed mean of the incubation period for SARS is 6.37. The observed mean of the time from onset to admission is about 3.75. Therefore, the observed sum 10.12 = 6.37+3.75 which is close to the estimation 11.83. Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong We shall apply the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS  in  Hong  Kong.  In  particular,  we  would  like  to explain the fact that a more or less constant background infection level remained present in Hong Kong for a long period  of  time,  on  which  superimposes  large  local  out- breaks at the several hospitals and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong. If we only consider those SARS  cases  from  the  community,  i.e.  we  take  away  the number of confirmed SARS cases from the Amoy Gardens and those from the local hospitals, then most of the daily new  number  of  confirmed  cases  from  the  community stayed around 15 to 25 (of course this level went down after strong confinement directives were implemented by the Hong Kong government). To  apply  our  model  to  study  the  outbreak  of  SARS  in Hong Kong, we assume that disease A is caused by SARS virus, while disease B is caused by some unknown virus and  disease  B  \"protects\"  people  from  being  infected  by SARS provided that they are infected by disease B first. We Case b We consider here the extreme case that IP(0) = 10, that is only 10 Hong Kong people are infected by disease B. S(0) is assumed to be 6.8 million and we still assume that E(0) = 100 and I(0) = 50. The parameters obtained by the gra- dient-based  optimization  algorithm  are  as  follows:  r  = 10.08 × 10-8, rP = 7.94 × 10-8, a = 0.52, aP = 0.12 and b = 0.105. The resulting curve for R fits well with the observed total number of confirmed cases of SARS from the com- munity from 17 March, 2003 to 10 May, 2003 (totally 55 days). Figure 6 is the curve for R, while Figure 7 shows the expected and observed daily new cases. The limiting value of the curve R is 1033. Note that a = 0.52 and b = 0.105 and  therefore  1/a  +  1/b  =  11.44  which  is  close  to  the observed figure 10.12. Both  the parameters rP and  a  are greater than the corresponding parameters in case a. This is reasonable as the initial population IP(0) = 10 is much smaller than the previous case. Therefore disease B needs to spread much faster in order to \"protect\" people from being infected by SARS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "9   Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Beijing We have also applied the SEIRP model to study the out- break of SARS in Beijing. The statistics on the numbers of SARS  cases in  Beijing  are  obtained from  http:// www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was set to be 13.82 millions; the other parameters (including the initial conditions) that charac- terise the model were optimised to obtain the best fit; we obtained thus E(0) = 400; IP(0) = 35000; I(0) = 340; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 7.69 × 10-8; rP = 10.79 × 10-8; a = 0.488; aP = 0.618; b = 0.103. Figure 8 and 9 show that the model fit well with the observation in both the numbers cumu- lative cases and the daily new cases. The total number of people infected with the protective virus is RP = 12 mil- lions. If the values of the parameters defining the model remain the same this simulation results in a final value of Case study : the Outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia Here we consider the outbreak of SARS in Inner Mongolia. The statistics on the numbers of SARS cases in Inner Mon- golia  are  obtained  from  http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/ yqfb/index.htm. The initial population S(0) was The total population  was  taken  to  be  S(0)  =  23.67  millions  ;  the other parameters (including the initial conditions) were optimised to ensure a good agreement with the data and were obtained to be E(0) = 2; IP(0) = 137638; I(0) = 32; R(0) = 0; RP(0) = 0; r = 1.62 × 10-8; rP = 3.87 × 10-8; a = 0.120, aP = 0.272; b = 7.644. The graphical representation of the simulation is given in figure 10 and figure 11. If the parameters above are used to simulate the future spread of epidemic we obtain the value of R∞ to be 350. Comment on the estimations of the parameters Note  that  there  are  two  possible  ways  of  estimating  the parameters in the model. The first one is  to  first  fix the values of a and b for all the different scenarios before the parameters r, rP and aP are chosen to fit the data. The sec- ond approach is simply choosing all the parameters to fit the data. We chose the second approach because we do believe that there are also some good reasons for the vari- ations of the parameters a and b in different cases. to  the  latent  period  of  the  disease;  as  such  it  is  indeed more characteristic of the disease itself than the parameter a but it may still be affected by the geographic region. For instance, the lifestyles of the people in Beijing and Inner Mongolia are very different because Beijing is the capital, and  hence  much  richer  (with  better  hygiene,  but  with more important air pollution). The value of the b param- eter will also be obtained from the fitting procedure. The  parameters  a  and  aP describe  the  removal  from  the classes I and IP to the classes R and RP respectively. Since the removed classes R are considered to contain the indi- viduals with infections the parameters a and aP character- ize  the  identification  rate  of  potential  cases;  it  is  then rather related to the health policy than to the disease itself (e.g. a is not the mortality rate!). Since health policies vary from places to places and the parameters a and aP are not directly related to the disease itself these parameters are not to be considered known but will rather be computed by fitting the simulation results to the data. Finally, our approach that not fixing the parameters a and b at the very beginning but rather than estimating them from  the  data  can  let  us  to  indirectly  verify  the  double epidemic hypothesis. In fact, as already pointed out in the paper, 1/a+1/b can be considered as the incubation period plus  the  onset  to  admission  interval.  For  the  two  Hong Kong scenarios we considered, our estimations are quite close to the observed figures. The parameter b describes the evolution from the exposed class E to the infectives class I; its reciprocal 1/b is related Note that in Hong Kong, r >rP but this relation is reversed in Beijing and Inner Mongolia. One possible reason for these differences is that the values of r and rP depend on how  the  daily  contact  patterns  of  people.  The  usual number of social contacts of a person is in general higher in big cities like Beijing and Hong Kong while lower in remote area like Inner Mongolia. This may explain the dif- ference of the r and rP values in these cases. 1200 s 1000 e s Observed a 800 c  f Expected o  r 600 e b m 400 u N 200 0 Discussion The  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  outbreak  is  the first  epidemic  of  the  XXIst  century.  We  do  not  know whether it will start again next autumn, and we need to combine a variety of approaches to tackle the epidemic, making  it  as  short  as  possible,  and  preparing  for  future similar, or less similar outbreaks. In this context, mathe- matical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the imme- diate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore  their  consequences  in  order  to  provide  political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rap- idly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition  there  are  huge  discrepancies,  within  the  same While parameters r and rP are related to the infective rates that may depend on the hygienic situation, the a's and b are closer to clinical properties of the infection. That they differ quite a lot in different scenarios is surprising. In par- ticular, the b value for Inner Mongolia is 76 times that of Beijing, implying that latency lasts so much longer in Bei- jing. One explanation is there may be a difference in the spread  of  the  \"protective\"  epidemic,  that  might  have started earlier at one of those places. Another explanation is  due  to  the  latent  immunodepression  of  the  people there.  This  means  that  people  do  not  build  up  a  strong immune response when infected, because they are either infected  by  other  viruses  (this  is  the  case  of  AIDS)  or because they are generally in poor health. Note that they were recently more or less submitted to a severe draught, which meant that they were probably undernourished. country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by  the  difference  between  the  number  of  SARS  cases  in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease. In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epi- demic. It is important to extract an outline of what is hap- pening  with  models  that  are  progressively  made  more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities  based  on  virus  behavior,  population dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major  situations.  One  when  the  epidemics  pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast signif- icant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavi- rus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the popu- lation of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its var- iant  caused  a  double  epidemic  when  it  changed  its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some pro- tection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one  being  highly  contagious  and  under  no  control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as Hong  Kong  and  the  Guangdong  province.  It  is  worth stressing  that  we  did  not  explore  the  intricacies  of  the mathematical  solutions  of  this  new  epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central rea- son for our approach is that the more parameters intro- duced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the move- ment of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may  be  inaccurate  (and  at  the  time  of  writing  this  is  a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model  represented  by  a  set  of  simple  differential  equa- tions.  A  drawback  of  this  approach  appears  when  the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involv- ing stochastic parameters would be more adapted. How- ever this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second con- straint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior  of  the  epidemic  is  so  complex  that  it  would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.  We  tried  to  overcome  these  difficulties  by restricting  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  fitting parameters  in  the  model.  Furthermore  we  checked  that 400 Observed cummulative 350 cases per day Predicted cummulative 300 cases 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-1 May-3 May-5 May-7 May-9 May-11 April-21 April-23 April-25 April-27 April-29 the  parameters  we  introduced  were  consistent  with  a purely  phenomenological  description  of  the  disease.  In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statis- tics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incu- bation  period  plus  the  time  from  onset  to  admission  is about  10.12  days.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a  + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Bei- jing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be rep- resented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the  size  of  the  epidemic  –  with  only  2  or  3  new cases for some days – is too small when compared with the  total  population  of  over  80  millions  :  in  this  case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the dif- ferential model is not relevant for this setting). Further- more we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development. Note  that  the  above  results  are  to  be  treated  with  care when  trying  to  validate  provisional  hypothesis.  Indeed, we  noticed  that  due  to  the  imprecision  inherent  in  the data  many  sets  of  parameters  display  good  fit  with  the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations.  However  some  qualitative  properties  of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to  be  important  when  analysing  this  epidemic.  For instance  one  important  problem  is  the  question  of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer,  here  we  cannot  say  that  the  epidemic  is  under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentar- ily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the  Exposed  class  is  still  high  (they  have  not  yet  been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then  be  out  of  control  again  when  in  people  in  the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessar- ily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature. An interesting outcome of the present model is that it can point  out  places  where  either  the  model  does  not  hold (indicating that there are other causes interfering with the disease) or that data collection is not accurate (providing a way to political authorities to enforce a new policy for identifying  patients  and  collecting  data).  A  second,  per- haps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of  the  virus  (or,  alternatively,  other  viruses  displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typi- cally what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation  that  needs  to  be  fully  documented).  We should  however  remain  cautious,  since  vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the varia- bility observed at different places. This might be substan- tiated  by  sequencing  CoV  genomes  isolated  from  many patients.  If  this  were  true,  then  the  reservoir  might  be much larger than suspected and SARS may happen again when  the  weather  cools  down  in  autumn.  Our  model would  then  be  useful  to  enforce  proper  precautionary measures immediately. Finally,  there  are  many  other  possible  scenarios,  and  as stated in the conclusion of the WHO panel held on 15–17 May  2003  in  Geneva:  \"Participants  from  the  main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of  outbreaks  in  different  countries  and  the  consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confine- ment or quarantine, and public information and educa- tion  to  encourage  prompt  reporting  of  symptoms.  The effectiveness  of  these  measures  was  observed  in  all  out- break  sites  under  widely  varying  conditions,  supporting the  overall  WHO  view  that  SARS  can  be  contained  and driven back out of its new human host.\" The present work aims at helping exploring one possible route accounting for at least some of the features of the epidemic. GT contributed to the derivation of the differential equa- tions that describe the model, carried out numerical sim- ulations and the parameter fitting procedures. AD provided the biological background for setting up the model and proposed, based on the 1983–1985 outbreak of coronavirus infection in European pigs the \"double epi- demic\" hypothesis.

Conclusions The first conclusion of the present work is that except at very restricted places recording a simple event, such as the Amoy Gardens Estate outbreak, the SIR model cannot rep- resent the unfolding of the SARS epidemic, even at its first steps. This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclu- sion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccu- rate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in  provinces  next  to  Beijing,  by  underreporting.  Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of pre- dicted  curves  with  actual  recent  data  indicate  that  the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by  governments  are  effective.  Furthermore,  this  model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS pre- cursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.   \n",
