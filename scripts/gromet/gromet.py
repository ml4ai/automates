    ( NOTE: the following notes make references to elements as they
            appear in Clay's gromet visual notation. )
    Terminology:
        *branch Predicate* (a type of Expression computing a
            boolean) represents the branch conditional test whose
            outcome determines whether the branch will be executed.
        *branch Function* represents the computation of anything in
            the branch
        A *branch* itself consists of a Tuple of:
                <Predicate>, <Function>, List[UidWire]
            The UidWire list denotes the set of wires relevant for
                completely wiring the branch Cond and Fn to the
                Conditional input and output Ports.
    Port conventions:
        Being a BoxDirected, a Conditional has a set of
            input and output Ports.
        *input* Ports capture any values of state/variables
            from the scope outside of the Conditional Box that
            are required by any branch Predicate or Function.
            (think of the input Ports as representing the relevant
            "variable environment" to the Conditional.)
        We can then think of each branch Function as a possible
            modification to the "variable environment" of the
            input Ports. When a branch Function is evaluated, it
            may preserve the values from some or all of the original
            input ports, or it may modify them, and/or it may
            introduce *new* variables resulting in corresponding
            new output Ports.
        From the perspective of the output Ports of the Conditional,
            we need to consider all of the possible new variable
            environment changes made by the selection of any branch.
            Doing so permits us to treat the Conditional as a modular
            building-block to other model structures.
            To achieve this, each branch Function must include in its
            output_ports a set of Ports that represent any of the
            "new variables" introduced by any branch Function.
            This allows us to have a single output_ports set for the
            entire Conditional, and whichever branch Function is
            evaluated, those Ports will be defined.
        NOTE: this does NOT mean those Ports are "Wired" and carry
            values; branch Function B1 may introduce a new variable
            "x" that branch Function B2 does not; B2 must still have
            a Port corresponding to "x", but it will not be Wired to
            anything -- it carries no value.
        Each branch Predicate has a single Boolean Port devoted to
            determining whether the branch is selected (when True).
    Definition: A Conditional is a...
        Sequence (List) of branches:
            Tuple[Predicate, Function, List[UidWire]]
        Each branch Predicate has a single boolean output Port
            whose state determines whether the branch Function
            will be evaluated to produce the state of the Conditional
            output Ports.
    Interpretation:
        GrFN provides unambiguous full data flow semantics.
        Here (for now), a gromet Conditional provides some abstraction
            away from pure data flow (but it is directly recoverable
            if desired).
        The interpretation convention:
            Branches are visited in order until the current branch
                Predicate evals to True
            If a branch Predicates evaluates to True, then branch
                Function takes the Conitional input_ports and sets
                determines the output_ports of the Conditional
                according to its internal components.
            If all no branch Predicate evaluats to True, then pass
                input Ports to outputs and new Ports have undefined
                values.

    Loop
        ( TODO:
            Assumes no side-effects.
            Assumes no breaks.
        )
    A BoxDirected that "loops" until an exit_condition (Predicate)
        is True.
        By "loop", you can think of iteratively making a copies of
            the Loop and wiring the previous Loop instance output_ports
            to the input_ports of the next Loop instance.
            (wiring of output-to-input Ports is done is order
             of the Ports).
    Definition / Terminology:
        A Loop has a *body* (because it is a Box), that
            represents the "body" of the loop.
        A Loop has an *exit_condition*, a Predicate that
            determines whether to evaluate the loop.
        A Loop has input_ports and output_ports (being
            a BoxDirected).
            A portion of the input_ports represent Ports
                set by the incoming external "environment"
                of the Loop.
            The remaining of the input_ports represent
                Ports to store state values that may be
                introduced within the Loop body
                but are not themselves initially used in
                (read by) the loop body wiring.
                In the initial evaluation of the loop,
                these Ports have no values; after one
                iteration of the Loop, these Ports
                may have their values assigned by the
                Loop body.
        Each input_port is "matched" to an output_port,
            based on the Port order within the input_ports
            and output_ports lists.
        A Loop has a *port_map* is a bi-directional map
            that pairs each Loop output Port with each Loop
            input Port, determining what the Loop input Port
            value will be based on the previous Loop iteration.
            Some input Port values will not be changed as a
            result of the Loop body, so these values "pass
            through" to that input's paired output.
            Others may be changed by the Loop body evaluation.
    Interpretation:
        The Loop exit_condition is evaluated at the very
            beginning before evaluating any of the Loop
            body wiring.
            IF True (the exit_condition evaluates to True),
                then the values of the Ports in input_ports
                are passed directly to their corresponding
                Ports in output_ports; The output_ports then
                represent the final value/state of the Loop
                output_ports.
            IF False (the exit_condition evaluates to False),
                then the Loop body wiring is evaluated to
                determine the state of each output Port value.
                The values of each output Port are then assined
                to the Port's corresponding input Port and
                the next Loop iteration is begun.
        This basic semantics supports both standard loop
            semantics:
            () while: the exit_condition is tested first.
            () repeat until: an initial input Port set to False
                make the initial exit_condition evaluation fail
                and is thereafter set to True in the Loop body.

Changes 2021-05-23:
() Added notes at top on Model Framework element Types
() Removed Event
() Wire tgt -> tgt

Changes 2021-05-21:
() Convention change: Model Framework typing will now be represented
    exclusively by the 'type' attribute of any TypedGrometElm.
    This is a much more clean way of separating syntax (the elements) from
        their semantics (how to interpret or differentially visualize).
    A Model Framework will designate what types are the TypedGrometElms may be. 
    For example, a Function Network will have 
        Port types: PortInput, PortOutput
        Wire types: WireDirected, WireUndirected
    For example, a Bilayer will have
        Port types: PortInput, PortOutput, PortRate
        Wire types: W_in, W_pos, W_neg
        Junction types; JunctionState, JunctionTangent
    In general, a Model Framework type will only be specified when
        a distinction between more than one type is needed.
() Changes to Wire:
    WireDirected and WireUndirected have been removed. All Wires have
        input -> src
        output -> tgt
        Despite the names, these are not necessarily directed, just in-principle
            distinction between the two.
        The 'type' determines whether a Wire has the property of being directed.
() Removed BoxDirected and BoxUndirected.
    The "facing" that Ports are associated with will now be represented
        in the Port 'type' Model Framework.
    Top-level Box now has 'ports' attribute. This is still required
        as we need to preserve information about ordering of Ports,
        both for positional arguments and for pairing inputs to outputs in Loop.
() Valued now includes 'value_type' attribute. 
    Previously was using Port, Junction and Wire 'type' to capture the 
        value type, but now the value type will be explicitly represented 
        by the value_type attribute.
    The 'type' attribute will instead be reserved for Model Framework type.
() Added 'name' to TypedGrometElm, so all children can be named
    The purpose of name: provide model domain-relevant identifier to model component 
() Metadatum is no longer a TypedGrometElm, just a GrometElm, as it is not
    itself a component of a model; it is data *about* a model component.
() Gromet object: added 'literals' and 'junctions' attributes
TODO:
    () Update docs to make explicit the convention for Port positional arguments
    () Update Loop docs to make explicit the convention for Port pairing

Changes 2021-05-17:
() FOR NOW: commenting out much of the Types, as likely source of
    confusion until sorted out.
() Added HasContents as a "mixin" that provides explicit lists
    of junctions, boxes, and wires.
    This is mixed-in to: Loop, Function and Relation.
() Added Valued class, a type of TypedGrometElm, that introduced
    the attributes of "value" (i.e., for things that can carry
    a value). This is now the parent to Junction, Port and Wire.
    This also distinguishes those classes from Box, which does
        not have a value, but is intended to transform or assert
        relationships between values.
() Changes to Loop:
    Removed "port_map" -- the pairing of input and output Ports
        is now based on the order of Ports in the input_ports and
        output_ports lists.
    Cleaned up documentation to reflect this.

Changes [2021-05-09 to 2021-05-16]:
() Added parent class TypedGrometElm inherited by any GrometElm that
    has a type. GrometElm's with types play general model structural roles,
    while other non-typed GrometElms add element-specific structure (such
    as Expr, RefFn, RefOp, Type, etc...)
() UidOp will now be reserved ONLY for primitive operators that are not
    explicitly defined within the gromet.
    All other "implementations" of transformations must have associated
        Box definitions with UidBox uids
() Introduced RefOp and RefFn to explicitly distinguish between the two
() Exp renamed to Expr
() Expr field "operator" -> "call", where type is now either RefOp or RefFn
() Expression changed from being a child of Function to being child of BoxDirected
() Changed Predicate to being an Expression
() Added Conditional, child of BoxDirected
() Added Loop, child of BoxDirected
() WireUndirected
    ports changed from List[Union[UidPort, UidJunction]]
    to Union[Tuple[UidPort, UidJunction],
             Tuple[UidJunction, UidPort],
             Tuple[UidPort, UidPort]]
    - should only have one pairwise connection per UndirectedWire
