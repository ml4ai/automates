## Overview

This report describes the Phase 1 AutoMATES prototype release. The overall architecture of the prototype remains the same as described in the [Month 1 Report Architecture Overview](/documentation/deliverable_reports/m1_architecture_report/). Since that report, significant progress has been made in all six core components, and significant portions of the pipeline can now run end-to-end, as demonstrated in the AutoMATES CodeExplorer (described in the [next section](#CodeExplorer)). The remaining components are executable as stand-alone modules and are soon to be completely integrated.

Each section in this report generally includes (where appropriate) the following information:

- Architecture: description of component software architecture and functionality details.
- Instructions for running the component(s).
- Data set(s): when applicable, a description of any data sets used and how to obtain them.
- Updates: summary of changes over the past two months, since the previous [Month 3 Report](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates/documentation/deliverable_reports/m3_report_prototype_system/).

All code comprising the AutoMATES prototype are available from the [AutoMATES](https://github.com/ml4ai/automates) and [Delphi](https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi/) Github repositories.
