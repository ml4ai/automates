## Overview

This report describes the Phase 1 AutoMATES prototype release. The overall architecture of the Prototype remains the same as described in the [Month 1 Report Architecture Overview](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates/documentation/deliverable_reports/m1_architecture_report/). Since that report, significant progress has been made in all eight main components, and now significant portions of the pipeline can run end-to-end, as demonstrated in the AutoMATES CodeExplorer, described in the [next section](#CodeExplorer). The remaining components are executable in stand-alone modules and will soon to be completely integrated.

Each section in this report includes the following subsections:

- Architecture: description of component architecture details.
- Instructions: ...for running the component(s).
- [Optional] Data set(s): description of any data sets used, and how to obtain them.
- Updates: summary of changes over the past two months, since the previous [Month 3 Report](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates/documentation/deliverable_reports/m3_report_prototype_system/).

All code comprising the AutoMATES Prototype are available from the [AutoMATES](https://github.com/ml4ai/automates) and [Delphi](https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi/) Github repositories.
