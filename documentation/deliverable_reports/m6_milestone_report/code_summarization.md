## Code Summarization

The code summarization team has begun focusing our attention on templated generation for summarizing the computations and structure of our extracted scientific models from GrFN. To meet this end we have begun investigating an architecture proposed in recent NLP literature that deals with [using neural templates for text generation](https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D18/D18-1356/). The idea behind using a templated generation method is that the source code we wish to summarize has well-specified control-flow structures that can be easily summarized via rules. Such structures as conditional statements, loops, indexed loops, and function calls are all well-defined components of the GrFN structure that allow for the construction of a skeletal summary. The neural generation methods can then be used to create a brief description of the actual computations being carried out in the function nodes that are contained within a GrFN structure. We are currently in the process of investigating what rule-based methods would be best for summarizing whole models or portions of models. Once we have developed templates from these rule-based methods we will begin experimenting with neural generation methods to fill function node computation descriptions within the templates.
