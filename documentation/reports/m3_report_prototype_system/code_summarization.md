### Encoder/decoder generation results

Our experiments with an encoder/decoder model showed that our model was
not able to acquire enough signal to adequately generate docstring
summarizations for source code. Our results indicated that the model was
failing to learn from the data. We decided on the three following tasks
that would help increase our models ability to learn from data and allow
us to debug what portions of the model may be failing. The first task is
to reassess the code/docstring corpus to see if there were avoidable
sources of error in the corpus and to attempt to gather more data. The
second task is to reassess the code/docstring embeddings by observing
the vocabulary size and determining whether lowering the vocabulary size
is possible, and whether it would aid the generation model. The third
task is to create a model for a simpler task (classification) that has
the same form as the model for our generation task that we can use to
assess whether their is enough signal for the generation model to be
able to generate docstring summarizations given our dataset. In the
following three sections we will outline the progress we have made on
these three tasks.

### Progress on code/docstring corpus

The team was able to increase the size of our overall code/docstring
corpus by indexing more Python packages to look for additional Python
functions that had PEP-style descriptive docstrings. We were able to
index additional Python packages from the following lists of packages:
the [anaconda
distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/py3.6_osx-64/),
the [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) list, and
the list of all available [SciKit
packages](http://scikits.appspot.com/scikits). In total, we increased the
amount of Python packages that we are searching for code/docstring pairs
to add to our corpus from only 24 to 1132. However, the amount of data
we discovered from these packages has only increased from roughly 22,000
examples to roughly 82,000 examples. This suggests that the variance in
functionality of code samples included in our dataset has greatly
increased. The following graphic gives a preview of the
styles of code-bases that have added the largest amount of
code/docstring pairs to our corpus.

### Progress on code embeddings

One of the biggest struggles for any embedding is to ensure that enough
examples are present for every token you wish to embed. Without a large
number of examples the embedding space cannot create meaningful
embeddings for corresponding tokens. In the case of creating embeddings
for code, it is likely the case that the names of functions are going to
be some of the most important tokens to embed, and unfortunately also
the most infrequent if the names are kept as a single token. From our
original dataset of 22,000 examples we had roughly 53,000 unique tokens
in the code portion of our corpus. The vast majority of these were
function or variable names that occurred fewer than five times each, not
nearly enough to be able to establish useful embeddings that capture the
type of semantic information carried in function or variable names.

We decided to address this issue by splitting function and variable
names into sub-components using `snake_case` and `camelCase` rules. In
order to preserve name semantics we added unique identifiers `<BoN>` and
`<EoN>` that specify the beginning and end of function/variable names.
Some examples of the tokenized forms of function names found in our
corpus before and after the transformation are provided in the following
table.

| Original tokenization       | Split-name tokenization                   |
| ---                         | ---                                       |
| `compute_ldap_message_size` | `<BoN> compute ldap message size <EoN>`   |
| `getComponentByPosition`    | `<BoN> get Component By Position <EoN>`   |
| `fromOpenSSLCipherString`   | `<BoN> from Open SSL Cipher String <EoN>` |
| `fromISO8601`               | `<BoN> from ISO 8601 <EoN>`               |

Splitting functions/variables lowered our code vocabulary size from
roughly 53,000 to roughly 16,000 unique tokens. It also lowered the
amount of tokens that appear fewer than five times from roughly 35,000
to roughly 5,000. This will give our code embeddings an incredible
boost in semantic power that will be useful for docstring generation.

### Docstring classification task

One of the difficulties with generation tasks is being able to tell
whether your model has enough signal from the data to be able to
generate affectively. In order to evaluate whether our dataset provides
enough signal for our generation task we have created a separate
classification task that will allow us to tell if our model has enough
signal from the input code/docstring pairs to be able to tell if a
docstring describes the code it has been paired with. Our choice of
classification task is to pair a code-block from our corpus with a
docstring and have our classifier determine if this pairing is accurate
(i.e. does the provided docstring correctly document the provided
code-block?). In the following sections we will describe the current
baseline model we are using for classification, present the two
classification datasets we are using, present some preliminary
classification results, and discuss the next steps for our
classification task research.

##### Baseline neural model description

Our initial classification model is a simplification from the model we
originally planned to use for generation. We constructed a model that
first embeds a code sequence using our pretrained code embeddings and
embeds a docstring using our pretrained docstring embeddings. The two
embedded sequences are each fed into their own respective [Bi-LSTM
recurrent
network](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf).
The final hidden state outputs from these networks are concatenated and
fed into a deep feed-forward neural network that produces a binary
classification of whether the docstring is correctly paired with the
provided function.

Our rationale for simplifying the model used for classification is that
we are currently simply testing to see if our data is providing enough
signal to aid in classification. Once we verify that we do have enough
signal to allow for decent classification results we will increase the
models complexity. It is important to note that since the main purpose
of the classification model is to test the fitness of our data for
generation we cannot add any docstring specific information to the
classification model, since such information would not be present during
docstring generation.

##### Random-draw and challenge dataset description

We have constructed two different datasets from our code/docstring
corpus that we plan to use to test our classification model. For each of
these datasets we are using a common practice in NLP known as negative
sampling to match code blocks with docstrings other than their correct
docstring. This creates instances for our classifier to correctly label
as mismatched pairs. The code blocks with their correct docstrings will
serve as instances for our classifier to label as correctly matched
pairs.

For our first dataset, we used complete random sampling to select our
negative examples. We named this dataset the random-draw dataset, and
its purpose is to be our first dataset to use when testing our
classifier. This is because the act of randomly selecting a negative
example docstring should greatly increase the chance that the docstring
selected has very little in common with the true docstring for the code
block and thus should be easily identified as a mismatch.  As such, this
dataset will be used for the earliest phases of experimentation with our
classifier. Once we determine that our classifier can do reasonably well
on the random-draw dataset we will move on to testing our model on our
second dataset.

For our second dataset we will use lexical overlap between the true
docstring for a code block and the other candidate docstrings to select
a candidate that has the highest lexical overlap with the true
docstring. We named this dataset the challenge dataset, and its purpose
will be to rigorously test our classifiers ability to correctly identify
whether a code/docstring pair is mismatched. We were able to build this
dataset by using [Apache lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/) to index and
query our set of docstrings. A sampling of five docstrings with their
negative example docstring of highest lexical overlap is provided in the
table below.

| Module paths <br> (source, negative)                     | Source docstring                                                                         | Best negative example                                                                                              |
| -------------                                            | -------------                                                                            | ------------                                                                                                       |
| `kubernetes.client.api`<br>`tabpy.client.rest`           | Builds a JSON POST object                                                                | Issues a POST request to the URL with the data specified . Returns an object that is parsed from the response JSON |
| `sympy.ntheory.multinomial`<br>`statsmodels.iolib.table` | Return a list of binomial coefficients as rows of the Pascal's triangle                  | Return list of Row , the raw data as rows of cells                                                                 |
| `matplotlib.image`<br>`PIL.image`                        | Set the grid for the pixel centers , and the pixel values                                | Gets the the minimum and maximum pixel values for each band in the image                                           |
| `mxnet.model`<br>`tensorflow.engine.training`            | Run the model given an input and calculate the score as assessed by an evaluation metric | Sets the metric attributes on the model for the given output                                                       |
| `twisted.internet.tcp`<br>`gevent.server`                | Create and bind my socket , and begin listening on it                                    | A shortcut to create a TCP socket , bind it and put it into listening state                                        |

As you may have noticed when looking at the final entry in the table,
sometimes the negative example for a code block seems to be a fitting
docstring for the code block. For instance, the final example in the
table above seems to have a negative example for `twisted.internet.tcp`
that would actually be a perfectly fine docstring for the function. We
welcome instances such as this in our challenge dataset, because this
will serve as noise that our model will need to learn to handle
appropriately. However, in order to ensure our dataset is not too noisy
we plan to include 10 negative examples for every positive example in
our challenge dataset, where the 10 examples included will be the 10
docstrings with the highest lexical overlap with the true docstring.
While it may be possible for the docstring with highest lexical overlap
to be a fitting docstring for the original code block it is highly
unlikely that the remaining nine docstrings will fit as well, thus the
amount of noise added to our challenge dataset from creating negative
examples via lexical overlap will be minimized.

##### Initial classification results

We have run our baseline model on our random-draw dataset that was
generated by our original corpus (22,000 pairs). After processing over
our training set for 35 epochs our validation set accuracy was 80%, a
figure that we are very excited about!

##### Next steps

Now that we have increased our corpus size and created our challenge
dataset, our immediate next task is to re-run our baseline model on both
the random-draw dataset and challenge dataset to see how the changes to
our code/docstring corpus affect our performance on our two datasets.

Pending encouraging results on the above experiments, we will then begin
increasing the complexity of our model by adding character embeddings
for the code/docstring tokens. We also plan to add attention layers to
the LSTM output from the code and docstring LSTMs that add attention on
the alternate sequence respectively. If the results from the above
experiments are not as good as we hoped then we will also investigate
adding more docstring data to our docstring embeddings from large online
documenation repositories such as
[ReadtheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) to improve the signal from our
docstring sequences.
