If one wishes to compute the second order indices, the total number of samples is increased. Once the samples have been generated, model outputs are generated from the input bounds and GrFN. The time taken to carry it out is given by 'Execution Time'. Finally, computation of indices is performed and the time taken to do so is given by the 'Analysis Time'. The speed of computation can be greatly enhanced if one were to use FAST and RBD-FAST methods. The disadvantage of using these techniques is the inability to calculate second order indices. Hence, we are only restricted to calculating the first and total order if such methods were to be implemented.*"
