    "The robustness of any model that is dependent on a set of input variables can be tested by performing a sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis are of two types - local and global. Unlike local sensitivity analysis which involves measurement of variations in model output with respect small perturbations in one single parameter, global sensitivity indices evaluate changes in model output as every single input parameter is varied simultaneously over their respective spaces. This allows the experimenter to measure the relative contributions of individual parameters as well as the interaction of the input parameters amongst themselves to the overall output variance. Although there are numerous methods available to perform global sensitivity analysis for eg., Sobol, Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST), and Random Balance Design-Fourier Sensitivity Test (RBD-FAST) etc., in this document, we shall focus on only Sobol and discuss in brief the utility and limitations of the other two methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methods mentioned previously all depend on a variance decomposition technique. Sobol method depends on the ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) representation of a mathematical model where the output variance is decomposed into linear summands of variance in the input parameters. These summands are computed through quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Each of the integrands in the ANOVA decomposition represents the order of input parameter contribution. Hence, the first order measures the variability in model output due to a single parameter whereas every subsequent higher order index quantifies the dependence of output variance on the interaction among the constituents of each parameter set. In the case of independent variables, the total sum of sensitivity indices over all parameter sets should be equal to one. It must be noted that while the indices computed from Sobol analysis can determine the extent to which a parameter affects variations in output, it cannot determine the cause of such an effect. Since Sobol relies on Monte-Carlo estimates of the integrands, they are approximated by averaging randomly sampled functions. Given below is a list of sample sizes (sample_list = [10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]) that will be used for computing sobol indices. While there is no singular rule on establishing a cut-off to determine which parameters have a large influence, for our purposes, we will choose 0.01 or higher to be significant, especially in complex models."

An important point that should be kept in mind is that sine these are variance computations, sobol indices are strictly non-negative. At the same time, as discussed before, such computations are only reliable if the sample size is large enough. Hence, in the two dimensional matrix shown below each cell contains the second order index for a given pair of input parameters. In the case of PETPT, only the pair of 'tmax' and 'srad' produces significant $S_{ij}$ wheras the interaction between any other pair of variables is negligible. Yet again, this result is not unexpected since 'tmax' and 'srad' are both positively correlated and their combined interaction would have great impact on the evapotranspiration rate. As before, to check if convergence has been established or not, we emphasize on plotting a diverging palette as the scheme of the colorbar. Since, there aren't any indices that are strongly negative (any negative index lies within a small interval centered around zero), we are confident that are calculations are accurate."

It is common knowledge that both dry air and larger wind speed would intesify the evapotranspiration process. The PETPNO tries to address these issues by including a new set of independent parameters in addition to the PETPT variables. Our results below indicate that in spite of the inclusion of other factors in the model, priamry contribution to the overall first order sensitivity index comes from solar radiation or 'srad', followed by the maximum, minimum as. well as the dew point temperatures ('tmax', 'tmin', 'tdew'), respectively. Since, there is substantial increase in the number of parameters and. the total sum of all indices is equal to one under the assumption of absence of multicollinearity, all $S_i$ indices are smaller in magnitude compared to their PETPT values. The parameter 'clouds' represents the relative cloudiness factor and takes into account the humidity of the surroundings. Sensitivity analysis shows that while the humidity does play a role in producing variations in the output, its overall effect is minimal. "

    "It is evident from the analysis above, that among all the parameters, only a handful of them will substantially cause significant changes in output variance. The input parameters of PETPT are shared by every single model. These include - 'tmax', 'tmin', 'srad', 'msalb', 'xhlai'. From our results, it becomes obvious that 'srad' is the most influential parameter with the largest first order Sobol index with the exception of PETPT. This must be taken with a grain of salt since sensitivity indices are highly dependent on the interval domains of parameters. After 'srad', daily maximum temperatures, 'tmax' and 'tmin' respecctively, are the most dominant factors. In the special case of PETPEN, 'eoratio' has a first order Sobol index similar to that of 'srad'. The tables below contain the total and first order Sobol indices for the various models with sample size of $10^5$. The trends in both these tables are identical and hence it can be inferred that the first order Sobol index of any parameter is the most dominating term in the ANOVA decomposition and therefore determines the overall contribution to perturbations in the output. Another interesting feature of the calculation comes from the comparison of the total Sobol indices in the penman-monteith models (PETPNO, PETPEN, PETDYN).  In all the three models, $S_T$ and $S_1$ of every shared variable have the same order of magnitude with the only exception of 'tdew'. While both $S_1$ and $S_T$ of 'tdew' in PETPNO is non-negligible, in PETDYN, only the total order, i.e., $S_T$ is relevant whereas, in PETPEN, 'tdew' has almost little to no contribution at all.  More interestingly, the indices computed for 'tmax' and 'tmin'. in these. models are almost equal."

    "Let us now compare the second order indices of the PET models. The simplest model with the minimum number of parameters is PETPT. PETPNO with four additional parameters, chief among them being 'windsp' and 'clouds', aim to model more complex phenomena. In the figure below, the shared set of parameters have indices highlighted in green (top. panels) whereas the bottom panel is reserved for non-shared parameters of individual models. Here, only PETPNO has non-empty set of non-shared variables whose indices are shown in bottom right panel (blue). From here onwards, we will adopt this same convention for other figures. On comparing their $S_2$ indices (see below), it becomes clear that 'srad' yet again plays a dominant role in its interaction with temperature in both models. However, the index resulting from the interaction between 'tmax' and 'srad' is relevant in PETPT and $S_2$ from 'tmin' and 'srad' is vanishingly small.In contrast, both these indices contribute equally in PETPNO. Beyond this, as has been discussed above, the interaction of 'clouds' and 'tdew' become important as well with significantly large contribution to the total index from 'tdew' (see table above). While one could go on to compare PETPT with the other penman-monteith models as well, it is apparent from our discussion in the preceding section that the picture will not be any different from what is seen below."

    "\n",
    "We have already stated that PETPNO and PETPEN models are functionally similar with minor differences, most notably among them is the introduction of the 'eoratio' parameter. We have already discussed the importance of 'eoratio' in sensitivity analysis since its first order index is almost similar to that of 'srad' but marginally smaller. However, on comparing their total indices ($S_T$),  we notice that 'eoratio' contributes more to the variance analysis. This is primarily because of higher order effects overtaking the first order term. As discussed before and. shown below, the interaction between 'eoratio' and ('srad', 'xhlai', 'tmax', 'tmin') all have significant impact which ultimately leads to 'eoratio' having the largest $S_T$. The other noticaeble difference between the two models in our sensitivity analysis comes from 'tdew',  which does not interact with the other variables in PETPEN. The dew point temperature however, has a moderately strong second order index once it is paired with 'clouds' that measures cloud cover."

    "We now compare our sensitivity analysis results of PETPNO and PETDYN. As in the case of PETPEN, the output of PETPNO has similar functional dependence as seen in PETDYN. We have already discussed how the effect of 'tdew' in PETDYN is virtually absent at the first order even though there is a significant contribution ($\\sim 0.1$) to S$_T$. Again, this can only be possible if higher order indices become large. From the plot below, we can see that in PETDYN, $S_{ij}$ between 'tdew' and 'clouds' is almost double of that in PEPNO. At the same time, the interaction between 'tdew' and 'srad' in PETPNO is several orders of magnitude smaller than what is observed in PETPNO. Everything else is almost identical."
